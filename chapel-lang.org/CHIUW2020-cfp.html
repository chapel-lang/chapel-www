<b style="color:red">Covid-19 Update:</b> Due to the global pandemic,
CHIUW 2020, like IPDPS itself, will not be held in-person in New
Orleans as originally planned.  Instead, we are moving CHIUW 2020 to
an online format that will be open to anyone who wishes to attend.

<h1><u>Call For Papers and Talks</u></h1>


<b><big>Summary</big></b><br>
<div class="indent">

<p>
<p>CHIUW 2020 is the 7th annual <a href = "CHIUW.html">Chapel
Implementers and Users Workshop</a>, held in conjunction with <a href
= "http://www.ipdps.org/">IPDPS&nbsp;2020</a>.  CHIUW serves as a
forum where users and developers of the Chapel language&nbsp;(<a href
= "https://chapel-lang.org">chapel-lang.org</a>) can gather to report
on work being done with Chapel, exchange ideas, and forge new
collaborations.  Anyone interested in parallel programming and Chapel
is encouraged to attend CHIUW, from long-term enthusiasts to those
simply curious to learn more.
</p>
</div>

<b><big>Topics</big></b><br>
</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>Topics of interest for CHIUW include:

<ul>
<li> User experiences writing applications in Chapel
<li> Improvements to the Chapel language, compiler, and runtime
<li> Performance or benchmark studies involving Chapel
<li> Libraries or tools for Chapel programmers
<li> Comparisons to other parallel programming models
<li> Uses of Chapel in education
<li> Related topics likely to be of interest to Chapel enthusiasts
</ul>

</p>
</div>


<p>
<b><big>Format</big></b> <br>
<div class="indent">

<p>CHIUW 2020 is a full-day workshop consisting of Chapel-related
presentations and sessions.  We also typically meet informally on a
second day to do interactive Chapel-related coding, design, or
community-building activities.

In more detail:
</p>


<p>
<a id = "talkday"></a>
<b>Talks Day:</b> The main day of CHIUW is primarily made up of
submitted presentations describing Chapel-related research and
development being undertaken by the community.  Those interested in
submitting talks or research papers should refer to the <a href =
"#submissions">Submissions</a> section below.

<p>Other workshop activities will include:

<ul>
<li> A keynote talk from TBA
<li> A pre-workshop introduction to Chapel for those new to the language
<li> A "State of the Chapel Project" talk
<li> An impromptu lightning talks session and/or
<li> A panel/community discussion on Chapel priorities and next steps
</ul>
</p>


<p>
<a id = "codeday"></a>
<b>Coding Day:</b></a> CHIUW 2020 will also include a separate coding
day on May 23.  This session is designed to support interactive
community activities like programming in Chapel, reviewing code,
performance debugging, designing new Chapel features or projects, etc.
If you have ideas or suggestions for activities you'd like to pursue
or see happen on this day, let us know at:
 <b><?php include("email-submissions.html");?></b>
</p>

<p>

<b><big>Submissions</big></b><br>
</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>Submissions to CHIUW 2020 can made in one of two forms:
(1)&nbsp;research papers (full or short) or (2)&nbsp;talk proposals.
All accepted submissions will be published as part of the IPDPS
workshop proceedings (IPDPS-W).  Papers that are not accepted for
publication at CHIUW 2020 will automatically be considered as a
talk-only submission as well.  The final set of decisions will be made
by the workshop's <a href = "#organization">program and steering
committees</a>.  All presentation materials will be archived on
the <a href = "CHIUW2020.html">CHIUW 2020</a> website.
</p>


<p>
<b>Paper Submissions:</b> CHIUW papers should describe novel R&amp;D
being undertaken by the authors.  CHIUW 2020 will accept full-length
papers of up to 10 pages, as well as short papers of up to 4 pages.
Papers will be evaluated by the program committee using typical
standards for academic research papers, including plagiarism (and
self-plagiarism).
</p>

<p>
<b>Talk Submissions:</b> To propose a talk at CHIUW without an
accompanying research paper, submit an extended abstract of 1 page in
length describing what you intend to present. CHIUW talks can preview
work that is not yet ready for publication, recap work that the
speaker has already published, and/or describe work that is not
intended for publication.  Talk proposals will be evaluated by the
program and steering committees based on their expected level of
interest to the CHIUW audience.
</p>

<p>
For either form of submission, please prepare your manuscript using
the <a href =
"https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE
conference format</a> and submit it via <a href =
"https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/ipdps/?page=Submit&id=CHIUWWorkshopFullSubmission&site=ipdps2020">linklings</a>
by the <a href = "#dates">submission deadline</a> below.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b><big>Other Ideas?</big></b>
</p>
<div class="indent">
Given Chapel's open-source nature, CHIUW is intended to become an
increasingly community-driven event.  To that end, if there is some
other activity that you would like to help make happen at CHIUW,
please let us know by
mailing <b><?php include("email-submissions.html");?></b>
