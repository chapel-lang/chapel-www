Chapel Compiler Release: README
===============================

This is the 1.2.0 release of the Chapel compiler, intended to give
potential users a look at what we're doing and the opportunity to
provide us with feedback.  See the AGREEMENT file for the release's
user agreement and the LICENSE file for its licensing terms.  Source
code contained within the third-party directory may contain its own
licenses -- see third-party/README for details.



-----------
Quick Start
-----------

1) Make sure that your shell is in the directory containing this
   README file.  For example:

        cd ~/chapel-1.2.0/chapel


2) Build the compiler and runtime libraries using:

        gmake

   or if your default make is GNU make compatible (as on Cygwin), use:

        make


3) Set up your environment to use Chapel.

   If you use...                               then type...

     ...a csh-compatible shell (csh, tcsh)     source util/setchplenv.csh
     ...a bash-compatible shell (bash)         source util/setchplenv.bash
     ...the Bourne shell (sh)                  . util/setchplenv.sh

   You must be in the "chapel" directory for these command scripts to
   work properly.

   If you use a different shell, refer to doc/README.chplenv for
   information about what environment settings you'll need to use
   Chapel satisfactorily (and if you're able to create an equivalent
   util/setchplenv.* script for your shell, please mail a copy of it
   to us at chapel_info@cray.com for inclusion in our next release).


4) Compile an example program using:

        chpl -o hello examples/hello.chpl


5) Execute the resulting executable:

        ./hello
