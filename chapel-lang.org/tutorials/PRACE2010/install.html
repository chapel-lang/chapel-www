To install and use Chapel on your own machine, take the following
steps:

<ol>

<p><li> Download version 1.2.0 of the release from <a href =
"http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/chapel">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/chapel</a>

<p><li> Unpack the release:

<ul>

<li> <b>cd</b> to a directory where you wish to install Chapel as a
subdirectory named <b>chapel/</b>
<li> <b>gunzip chapel-v1.2.0.tar.gz</b>
<li> <b>tar xf chapel-v1.2.0.tar</b>
</ul>

<p><li> Read the top-level <a href = "README">README</a> to build the
compiler, set up your environment, and compile and run your first
sample program.

<p><li> The bottom of the README has possible next steps for exploring
the release.  For this session, we recommend exploring the examples/
directory, working through the exercises on the previous page, or
writing up a program of your own liking; but you're welcome to do
whatever appeals to you.

<p><li> For best results, we recommend using Chapel in a single-locale
multithreaded mode.  Once you are comfortable with that, you may want
to move on to multi-locale Chapel which supports multi-threaded
execution across a distributed memory system.  See
$CHPL_HOME/doc/README.multilocale for instructions to get started.

</ol>
