<h2>PRACE 2010 Autumn School: Chapel Hands-on Session</h2>


<p><b>Getting Access to Chapel</b><br>

There are two main ways to use Chapel for this hands-on session:

<ol>

<li> <a href = "classroom.html">Use a pre-installed version of
Chapel</a> This classroom has machines with Chapel pre-installed for
your use.  Once you are comfortable with Chapel on a Linux desktop,
you can optionally run it on MareNostrum.

<li> <a href = "install.html">Install Chapel on your own machine</a>
If you would prefer to use your own installation of Chapel, you may
install it yourself.  For best results, try installing on a local
laptop or remote system running Linux, Mac OS X, or Cygwin.

</ol>



<p>&nbsp;


<p><b>Support for vim/emacs</b><br>
<ul>
As you work through this hands-on session, note that Chapel has
support for syntax coloring and formatting for vim and emacs.  The vim
support is reasonably good; the emacs support is imperfect but better
than nothing.  To use, see $CHPL_HOME/etc/README once you have a
working copy of Chapel.
</ul>
