To use Chapel on a PRACE classroom machine, take the following steps:

<ol>

<p><li> Log in to an instructional machine using username and
password <b>bsc</b>.

<p><li> When you log in, you should find your environment set up to
use Chapel.  For example, $CHPL_HOME should point to the Chapel
installation, the Chapel compiler (<b>chpl</b>) should be in your path
and should be able to use 'man chpl' to read its man page.

<p><li> To get started, read the top-level <a href =
"README">README</a>, starting at step 4 (steps 1-3 assume you've just
downloaded Chapel from the internet) to compile and run your first
sample program.

<p><li> The bottom of the README has possible next steps for exploring
the release.  For this session, we recommend exploring the
$CHPL_HOME/examples/ directory, working through the exercises on the
previous page, or writing up a program of your own liking; but you're
welcome to do whatever appeals to you.

<p><li> For best results, we recommend using Chapel in a single-locale
multithreaded mode.  Once you are comfortable with that, you may want
to experiment with using multi-locale Chapel on your instructional
machine by running multiple processes on it.  To do this set the
following environment variables:

<ul>
<li> export CHPL_COMM=gasnet
<li> export GASNET_SPAWNFN=L
</ul>

See $CHPL_HOME/doc/README.multilocale for further instructions.  You
can also try using Chapel on MareNostrum, a large-scale distributed
memory machine.  See the instructor for further instructions.

</ol>
