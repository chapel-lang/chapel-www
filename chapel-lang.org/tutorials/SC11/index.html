<p><b>Getting Access to Chapel</b><br>

<ul>
Start by <a href = "install.html">installing Chapel on your own
machine</a>.  Installing Chapel is quite easy on most UNIX-based
desktops including Linux and Mac OS X.  Windows users may use Cygwin,
but it tends to be very slow, so you may have a better time by ssh-ing
to a remote UNIX platform and working there or by partnering with
someone else.
</ul>


<p>&nbsp;


<p><b>Support for vim/emacs</b><br>
<ul>
As you work through this hands-on session, note that Chapel has
support for syntax coloring and formatting for vim and emacs.  The vim
support is reasonably good; the emacs support is imperfect but still
quite a bit better than nothing.  To use, see $CHPL_HOME/etc/README
once you have a working copy of Chapel.
