<h2>SC10 Chapel Tutorial: Hands-on Session</h2>


<p><b>Getting Access to Chapel</b><br>

There are two main ways to use Chapel for this hands-on session:

<ol>

<li> <a href = "install.html">Install Chapel on your own machine</a>
Installing Chapel is quite easy on most UNIX-based desktops including
Linux and Mac OS X.  Windows users may use Cygwin, but it tends to be
very slow, so you may have a better time by ssh-ing to a remote UNIX
platform and working there or by partnering with someone else.

<p>
<li> We also have a dozen accounts on a Cray CX1000 with access to a
pre-installed version of Chapel for those who would prefer not to deal
with installation.  Ask an instructor for an account if you are
interested.

</ol>



<p>&nbsp;


<p><b>Support for vim/emacs</b><br>
<ul>
As you work through this hands-on session, note that Chapel has
support for syntax coloring and formatting for vim and emacs.  The vim
support is reasonably good; the emacs support is imperfect but still
quite a bit better than nothing.  To use, see $CHPL_HOME/etc/README
once you have a working copy of Chapel.
</ul>
