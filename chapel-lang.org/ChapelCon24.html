        <b>Abstract:</b> 
            For the past few years, seniors at Western Washington University
            have been working towards building an intuitive and productive
            debugging tool for the Chapel programming language. Our project
            integrates essential features of GDB within a new framework designed
            to support Chapel programming. This is a work-in-progress report
            from which we hope to gain valuable insight from the Chapel
            community to help us provide a tool that is truly useful and
            practical.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
            Many modern programmers expect a degree of intelligence from their
            editor. For established languages (e.g., Python, C++, Rust) such
            intelligence is embodied by support for a variety of features,
            including autocompletion, hover information, error diagnostics, and
            much more. Chapel, until recently, has lacked these features;
            however, developments in Chapel's new compiler front-end have made
            it possible to develop such tools by leveraging the Language Server
            Protocol. In this talk, we demonstrate the editing features made
            possible by a new Chapel-based linter and language server. These
            range from 'essentials' (go-to-definition, hover information) to
            Chapel-specific tools such as detecting compile-time control flow
            and instantiations. The demonstrations will use Visual Studio Code,
            but these features work with many common editors.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
            The Computer Language Benchmarks Game (CLBG) is a website that
            compares a couple dozen programming languages using a suite of ten
            benchmarks. Though each benchmark is relatively simple, collectively
            they exercise aspects of programming that are likely to be of
            interest to various communities or use cases, such as dynamic memory
            management, arbitrary-sized integers, regular expressions,
            vectorization, etc. In this talk, I'll describe changes that we made
            to the Chapel versions of the benchmarks in support of the Chapel
            2.0 release and the resulting impact on Chapel's standing on the
            website. I'll also identify ways in which the Chapel entries could
            be improved further in terms of capabilities, speed, or elegance.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
            Chapel supports productive parallel application development on a
            wide range of computing platforms. A single source file can be
            compiled for multiple target architectures through the LLVM compiler
            framework, allowing Chapel code generation to target diverse
            back-ends, such as PTX for NVIDIA GPUs and AMDGCN for AMD GPUs. This
            talk will address the question: how well does Chapel support the
            development of performance-portable application codes compared to
            more widely-used programming models like OpenMP and Kokkos?
            We will evaluate Chapel 2.0's performance portability, building on
            our previously published evaluation of Chapel 1.33. We will claim
            that Chapel's performance portability on heterogeneous architectures
            is comparable to existing models. However, we have also identified
            several implementation issues that reduce Chapel's performance
            portability on certain platforms, in some cases requiring code to be
            significantly modified to perform well on GPUs.

            different vendors. This variety brings, along with the heterogeneity
            challenge, both the code and performance portability challenges. In
            this context, Chapel's native GPU support comes as a solution for
            code portability between different vendors. In this paper, we
            investigate the viability of using the Chapel high-productivity
            language as a tool to achieve both code and performance portability
            in large-scale tree-based search. As a case study, we implemented a
            distributed backtracking for solving permutation combinatorial
            problems. Extensive experiments conducted on big N-Queens problem
            instances, using up to 512 NVIDIA GPUs and 1024 AMD GPUs on Top500
            supercomputers, reveal that it is possible to scale on the two
            different systems using the same tree-based search written in Chapel.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
            Sorting is a critical algorithm in the Arkouda exploratory data
            analytics library. At CHIUW 2023, we presented initial performance
            results for a multi-GPU sort implementation on NVIDIA GPUs,
            implemented using the Chapel GPU API. In this talk, we will update
            the Chapel community on our efforts to implement a scalable
            distributed GPU sort on the Frontier system at Oak Ridge Leadership
            Computing Facility. We will discuss the interaction between sorting
            algorithms and system architecture with regard to the particular
            features of Frontier. We will also present initial performance
            results for sorting a large dataset on multiple nodes of Frontier,
            and discuss opportunities for further performance improvements.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
Parallel processors have finally dominated all scales of computing hardware,
from the personal and portable to the ivory tower datacenters of yore.  However,
dominant programming models and pedagogy haven't kept pace, and languish in a
post-serial mix of libraries and language extensions. Further, heterogeneity in
the form of GPUs has dominated the performance landscape of the last decade,
penetrating casual user markets thanks to data science, crypto and AI booms.
Unfortunately GPUs' performance remains largely constrained to expert users by
the lack of more productive and portable programming abstractions. This talk
will probe questions about how to rethink and democratize parallel programming
for the masses. By reflecting on lessons learned from a decade and a half of
accelerated computing, I'll show where Chapel 2.0 fits into the lineage of GPU
computing, can capitalize on GPU momentum, and lead a path forward.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
            Exercism is an open-source website that aims at teaching programming
            and programming languages. The platform has hundreds of exercises
            for roughly 70 programming languages. One core principle of exercism
            is to make learning a collaborative community experience.
            Experienced programmers in a language can volunteer as mentors and
            give feedback to people solving exercises to learn. All tracks are
            also open for contributions and development.

            <p>
            During the past year, I have developed a Chapel track on exercism,
            which is now ready to be launched. During this talk, I will
            introduce exercism and its community and describe the structure of
            the Chapel curriculum.
            </p>

            <p>
            The purpose of this talk, in addition to increasing visibility of
            the Chapel track on exercism as learning resource, is also to
            discuss the pedagogical and design choices of the Chapel curriculum,
            current features, roadmap and how others in the Chapel community can
            get involved to help developing the curriculum further.

            This talk recounts a new Chapel developer's experience writing a
            machine learning library from scratch in Chapel. It gives an
            overview of the technical foundations of the library, as well as
            some comparisons with a similar library written in Python, both from
            a performance and language-capabilities perspective. The author's
            overall experience with learning Chapel Programming Language is
            summarized. Some additions to the language are proposed that may
            improve its applicability to Machine Learning applications and
            research.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
            The design and implementation of algorithms for increasingly large
            and complex modern supercomputers requires the definition of data
            structures and workload distribution mechanisms in a productive and
            scalable way. In this talk, the focus is on parallel tree-based
            algorithms that explore unbalanced trees using the Depth-First
            Search (DFS) strategy. Due to their irregular and unpredictable
            nature, such algorithms raise multiple challenges, such as dynamic
            load balancing. We exploit the Chapel's DistributedBag package
            module that provides the DistBag data structure and a work-stealing
            (WS) mechanism for this class of algorithms. It consists in a highly
            parallel segmented multi-pool specialized for DFS, and WS takes
            place when a given worker gets out of work. In the context of this
            work, we provide a "getting started" tutorial of the data structure,
            and demonstrate its performance at scale. According to the
            experimental results, it is shown that our application achieved 50%
            of strong scaling efficiency using 400 computer nodes solving
            instances of the Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem using the
            Branch-and-Bound technique.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
            The restriction that procedures as arguments need to be first-class
            in Chapel is circumvented by the definition of a record type that
            carries both an array and its attached domain. This
            "attached-domain" array can then be used trivially in a Chapel
            implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt method as a
            proof-of-concept. The approach was successfully tested with
            real-world meteorological data to fit a model for atmospheric
            radiation and one for albedo over a rice paddy in Rio Grande do Sul
            State, Brazil.

            Network analysis is a set of techniques that facilitate the
            exploration of datasets that exhibit connectivity across various
            domains including cybersecurity and health. Central to these
            techniques is the representation of such datasets as graphs, the
            fundamental abstract data type ubiquitous in computing sciences.
            Leveraging graphs, data scientists unlock a suite of analytical
            operations, ranging from assessing connectivity through triangle
            counting to constructing hierarchical vertex views from a given
            source vertex, or identifying connected graph components. In this
            talk, we introduce Arachne, a graph analysis tool tailored for
            Python users, built on the popular Chapel analysis framework,
            Arkouda.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
            Chapel is one of those extremely rare HPC languages in which the
            imaginary type is a first class floating point type. The difficulty,
            or ease, of an implementation of a core set of IEEE 754 elementary
            mathematical routines which have an imaginary argument are
            discussed. This refinement (or specialization) of the more
            traditional approach to elementary mathematical routines in the
            complex domain captures how the Chapel language achieves one
            particular aspect of "the completeness and consistency of IEEE
            arithmetic" at no cost and with relative ease.

            Generally, users author these UDFs as a plugin in C++. However,
            we’ve recently been working on enabling Chapel support for UDFs,
            such that users can write their entire domain-specific UDFs in
            Chapel alone, without needing any C++ glue code.  We were able to
            quickly and easily implement this support thanks to the robust
            Chapel Python AST interface: simply author your Chapel as normal,
            adhering to a couple of conventions regarding return types, and we
            will analyze the resulting Chapel AST and automatically generate the
            required C++ module code required for the UDF.
            </p>

            <p>
            This talk will give a quick overview of a very simple Chapel UDF
            module, as well as the AST analysis code, finishing with an
            integrated demo of calling a Chapel UDF directly from a SELECT
            statement and having everything run optimally on the GPU.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
            A previous study assessed the performance vs code complexity of a 1
            dimensional heat equation code across HPX (C++), Rust, Julia, Swift,
            HPX, Charm++, Chapel, and Go. The study demonstrated Chapel and HPX
            yielded best performance with respect to code complexity ratios.
            This paper investigates the performance and code complexity ratios
            yielded by the Chplx compiler. Chplx is a new source-to-source
            compiler that translates Chapel to C++. Chplx intends to close the
            code complexity gap between Chapel and HPX. Performance and code
            complexity differentials between Chapel and HPX are measured across
            3 benchmarks. The paper assesses performance using the original
            study's heat equation code, GUPS, and Streaming Triad. Code
            complexity is measured using the COnstructive COst MOdel (COCOMO)
            model. Chplx creates ISO C++ application code using a new ISO C++20
            library implemented using the HPX asynchronous many task (ATM)
            runtime system. The new ISO C++20 library closely mirrors the Chapel
            programming language's functionality and demonstrates HPX's
            viability as a suitable runtime system for Chapel.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
            Last year at CHIUW23 we described a solution that enables ordinary
            Python programmers to use Fabric-Attached Memory to share
            incremental results while working efficiently with datasets that can
            be too large to process using a single commodity machine. For
            ChapelCon 2024, we report on tuning our system for performance.
