          <dd><i>This talk is a fairly comprehensive overview of
          Chapel's themes, features, and status, with a bit more
          emphasis on the implementation and multiresolution design of
          the language than a typical talk allows for.</i></dd>

      <dd><i>This keynote provided a review of some of the
      productivity metrics that were pursued under the DARPA HPCS
      program, but then argued that productivity seems like a very
      personal/social decision and that it therefore should be studied
      in forums supporting personal/social decisions.  Two specific
      proposals are made.</i></dd>

      <dd><i>This talk surveys past approaches to benchmarking from a

      of importance.  It wraps up by advocating for an HPC equivalent

      ZPL's support for data-parallel array-based programming, lists
      reasons that ZPL was ultimately limited, and how we addressed
      those limitations in Chapel's design.</i></dd>
