          use the 'begin' construct in Chapel to create fire and
          forget-style tasks, which do not perform any implicit
          synchronization with the parent task. While this provides a
          good facility to invoke parallel tasks, it poses issues when
          the child task accesses a variable declared in the scope of
          its ancestor. If the parent task exits before the child, its
          scope is deallocated and the child may end up accessing a
          memory location that is no longer valid. The child task must
          synchronize with the parent task to ensure legal access to
          its variables, for example by means of atomic variables,
          sync statements, or sync and single synchronization
          variables.  In this work, we address the above issue with a
          compile-time partial inter-procedural analysis for outer
          variable accesses in begin tasks to identify and report
          potentially dangerous accesses. We make use of a Concurrent
          Control Flow Graph to generate all possible run-time
          Parallel Program States (PPS).  All outer variable accesses
          that are potentially dangerous in the generated PPS are then
          reported to the user for rectification.</font></small>

    <td><small><b>Abstract:</b> <font color="DarkBlue">The last decade
          has seen an explosion of interest and diversity in
          large-scale computing.  Many scientists are interested in
          seizing the opportunities these emerging new platforms,
          compiler frameworks, and languages provide, aiming for
          bigger simulations, more data, or higher levels of
          computational productivity in their research than had been
          feasible before.

          <p>But with the landscape so quickly changing and so many new
          tools becoming available, it is hard to know where to focus
          attention.  How is a researcher to choose a language to
          start a new project in when new possibilities appear so
          often?  There are new languages for scientific computing
          like Julia, which has linear algebra built in but only
          modest parallel computing support.  There are frameworks
          like Spark, which is parallel and cluster-enabled from the
          beginning, but targeted for data analysis rather than
          simulation.  There are old stalwarts like R which grow
          tendrils into tools like Spark or SCALAPACK; and even new
          non-number crunching languages like Rust and Swift are
          starting to have scientific computing adherents.</p>

          <p>Chapel is a language from Cray that has fields over
          domains as first-class entities, allowing for efficient and
          productive parallel domain-decomposed computations.  Where
          does Chapel fit in amongst these new languages; when should
          a researcher use Chapel, when should they use one of the
          others, and what ideas and techniques are out there that
          could Chapel usefully adopt?  Itâ€™s these questions I'll
          address in this talk.</p>

          <p>Iâ€™ll give a brief overview of some of these other
          platforms and languages that are being adopted for different
          types of scientific computing, and compare them to Chapel in
          the context of two quite different types of scientific
          problems - high speed fluid flow, and genomic
          bioinformatics.  Weâ€™ll discuss pros and cons, when to use
          each, and look at what ideas could be poached by Chapel and
          its community.</p>

          adoption of a programming language is positively influenced
          by the breadth of its software libraries. Chapel is a modern
          and relatively young parallel programming language.
          Consequently, not many domain-specific software libraries
          exist that are written for Chapel. Graph processing is an
          important domain with many applications in cyber security,
          energy, social networking, and health. Implementing graph
          algorithms in the language of linear algebra enables many
          advantages including rapid development, flexibility,
          high-performance, and scalability.  The GraphBLAS initiative
          aims to standardize an interface for linear-algebraic
          primitives for graph computations. This paper presents
          initial experiences and findings of implementing a subset of
          important GraphBLAS operations in Chapel. We analyzed the
          bottlenecks in both shared and distributed memory. We also
          provided alternative implementations whenever the default
          implementation lacked performance or scaling.</font></small>

          observed that base performance of Chapel ranges from
          41%-184% that of OpenMP.  The optimization techniques we
          discussed shows performance improvements ranging from 1.4x
