<b><big>Overview</big></b><br /> 
</p>
<div class="indent">

<p>CHIUW 2015&mdash;the <a href = "http://www.sigplan.org/">ACM
SIGPLAN</a> second annual <a href = "CHIUW.html">Chapel Implementers
and Users Workshop</a>, to be held in conjunction with <a href =
"http://conf.researchr.org/home/pldi2015">PLDI 2015</a> at <a href =
"http://fcrc.acm.org/">FCRC 2015</a>&mdash;will continue our annual
series of workshops designed to bring developers and users of the
Chapel language (<a href =
"https://chapel-lang.org">chapel-lang.org</a>) together to report on
work being done with the language across the broad open-source
community and move Chapel forward.  Attendance is open to anyone
interested in Chapel, from the most seasoned Chapel user or developer
to someone simply curious to learn more.
</p>
</div>


<p>
<b><big>Format</big></b> <br />
<div class="indent">

<p>The first day of the workshop will be presentation- and discussion-
based, similar to <a href = "CHIUW2014.html">CHIUW
2014</a>&mdash;essentially, a full-day mini-conference focusing on
Chapel.  This year, we are also extending CHIUW to include an
additional half day in support of interactive pair-programming and
code-camp style activities.  The program can be found at <a href =
"CHIUW2015.html">chapel-lang.org/CHIUW2015.html</a> as it is
formulated.
</p>


<p>
<b>Mini-Conference Day:</b> Like last year at IPDPS, the backbone of
the first day of CHIUW will be composed of talks from members of the
Chapel community describing work they are undertaking within the
context of Chapel.  Other activities during this first day will
include:

<ul>
<li> A pre-workshop introduction to Chapel for those new to the language
<li> A "State of the Chapel Union" talk
<li> A keynote by Bill Carlson (IDA)
<li> A community/panel discussion on Chapel's next steps and future
</ul>

<p>
Interested parties are encouraged to propose talks using the
submission process outlined below.  The selection of speakers and
final program will be curated by the workshop's program committee.
While speakers are welcome to prepare a paper to complement their
talk, there is no requirement to do so, nor will there be any formal
proceedings for this workshop.  More specifically, presenting research
results at this workshop is not intended to preclude their submission
and publication at more established conferences and workshops.  All
talk slides, papers, and materials developed for the workshop will be
archived on the workshop website.
</p>

<p>
<a id = "codecamp"></a>
<b>Code Camp Day:</b></a> The format of the second day will be less
structured, but is expected to involve pair-programming/code-camp
activities in which members of the core Chapel team will partner with
users working to express computations in Chapel or developers striving
to gain a better knowledge of the Chapel code base.  If you have a
specific topic or activity that you would like to propose for this day
(e.g., "I'd like to work with someone to try coding algorithm x in
Chapel" or "I'd like someone to help me get familiar with aspect y of
the Chapel compiler/runtime/module code base"), please submit it using
the process below.
</p>

<p>
<b><big>Call For Submissions</big></b><br />
</p>

<div class="indent">

<b>Talk Proposals:</b> If you have Chapel-related work that you would
like to present during day one of CHIUW in a ~20&ndash;30 minute talk,
please submit an extended abstract
to <b><?php include("email-submissions.html");?></b>.  Your submission
should not exceed one page in 11-point font, and it should contain:

<ul>
<li> The title of the talk
<li> The list of authors and their affiliations
<li> The presenting author
<li> A detailed description of the work you intend to present
</ul>

<p></p>
<a id = "hotTopics"></a>
<b>Hot Topics Talk Proposals:</b></a> As a means of featuring a greater
number of topics and speakers at CHIUW 2015, we've decided to add a
"Chapel Hot Topics" session to this year's agenda.  This session will
be composed of a handful of short (~10 minute) talks.  To propose a
hot topic talk, send the following information
to <b><?php include("email-submissions.html");?></b> by April 9th,
2015:
<ul>
<li> The title of the talk
<li> The speaker and his/her affiliation
<li> a one-paragraph abstract for the talk
</ul>


<p>
<b>Code Camp Proposals:</b> If you have a pair-programming or
code-related activity that you would like to see occur on day two of
the workshop, please send a short paragraph describing it
to <b><?php include("email-submissions.html");?></b>.  We hope to be
able to accept all reasonable proposals, the primary constraint being
the number of core Chapel team members available at the workshop to
help lead them.  For this reason, from a planning/resource
perspective, the earlier we receive these proposals the better, though
we will consider additional ad-hoc activities right up to the day
itself (to support new ideas that come up during day one, for example).
</p>

<p>
<b>Other Proposals:</b> Chapel is a community language and our
intention is for CHIUW to become an increasingly community-run event,
so if you have proposals for other activities that you would like to
see take place at CHIUW (particularly if you're interested in leading
that activity), please let us know.
