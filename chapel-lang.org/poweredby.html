<b>Arkouda (αρκούδα):</b> NumPy-like Arrays at Massive Scale for Python<br>

    <b>What:</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Arkouda allows a user to interactively issue from the Python3
    interpreter massively parallel computations on distributed data
    using functions and syntax that mimic NumPy, the underlying
    computational library used in the vast majority of Python data
    science workflows. The computational heart of Arkouda is a Chapel
    interpreter that accepts a pre-defined set of commands from a
    client (currently implemented in Python) and uses Chapel's
    built-in machinery for multi-locale and multithreaded
    execution. Arkouda has benefited greatly from Chapel's distinctive
    features and has also helped guide the development of the
    language.

  </dt>
  <dd>
    CHAMPS is multi-physics software oriented toward fluid dynamics,
    written completely in Chapel and developed to solve systems of
    equations in a general manner. A key theme is to easily expand the
    capabilities of the software while keeping good performance on
    distributed memory. The software currently handles 2D and 3D
    unstructured grids to solve RANS equations with a finite volume
    approach using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model for closure.
    Different spatial discretization schemes and linear solvers can be
    used, including a variety of solvers from the PETSc library for
    which an API has been developed. Other C libraries for which APIs
    were developed in this project include the CGNS (CFD General
    Notation System) library, the Intel MKL library and the METIS
    library. The overall performance achieved with Chapel is
    comparable to equivalent C/C++/MPI approaches.  Future
    developments will include multi-fidelty simulations in
    aerodynamics, aero-elasticity, and aero-icing.

<b>CHGL:</b> Hypergraph Analytics in Chapel <img border="0" style="height:1.5em; vertical-align:middle;" src = "images/chgl-logo.png" alt="CHGL logo"><br>

  </dt>
  <dd>
    The Chapel Hypergraph Library (CHGL) is a library for hypergraph
    computation in the Chapel language. Hypergraphs generalize graphs,
    where a hypergraph edge can connect any number of vertices. Thus,
    hypergraphs capture high-order, high-dimensional interactions
    between multiple entities that are not directly expressible in
    graphs. CHGL is designed to provide HPC-class computation with
    high-level abstractions and modern language support for parallel
    computing on shared- and distributed memory systems.

    This project aims at programming distributed algorithms for
    solving big instances of combinatorial optimization problems,
    taking into account productivity, parallel efficiency,
    heterogeneity, and fault tolerance.  This project comprises
    heuristic and exact optimization algorithms, and its main
    application is a distributed Branch-and-Bound for solving
    permutation-based combinatorial problems.

  <dd>
    <i>chplUltra</i> is designed to simulate the dynamics of
    ultra-light dark matter for astrophysics. Ultralight dark matter
    is a relatively new proposal designed to alleviate some of the
    challenges faced by the more traditional WIMP (weakly interacting
    massive particles) candidates. It has a rich phenomenology,
    including the formation of Bose-Einstein condensate solitons and
    interference effects from the wave-like behavior of the
    particles. chplUltra is a pseudo-spectral fixed grid code designed
    to evolve the Schrodinger-Poisson equations. The code uses a
    Chapel <a href =
    "https://github.com/npadmana/DistributedFFT">distributed FFT</a>
    routine, built around the serial FFTW library. Using Chapel allows
    the authors to rapidly extend the code and to simultaneously scale
    it out to ~100s of nodes. The code has been run on up to 512 nodes
    (18k cores) on a Cray XC system.

    CrayAI is a suite of distributed machine learning workflow
    libraries designed with HPC in mind.  These libraries are
    portable, running on anything from a laptop up to a supercomputer.
    The core back-end of these libraries is written in Chapel, while
    the user-facing interface is Python.  CrayAI currently consists of
    Cray HPO and Cray FS. Cray HPO is a distributed black-box
    hyperparameter optimization framework and Cray FS is a distributed
    feature selection library.
