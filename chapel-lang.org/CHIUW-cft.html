<h2>CHIUW: Chapel Implementers and Users Workshop</h2>
<h3>Friday, May 23rd, 2014</h3>
<h4>Call For Participation</h4>
</center>

<p>
CHIUW&mdash;the Chapel Implementers and Users Workshop, to be held in
conjunction with <a href = "http://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2014/">IPDPS
2014</a>&mdash;will be the first in what is anticipated to be an
annual series of workshops designed to bring developers and users of
the Chapel language (<a href =
"https://chapel-lang.org">https://chapel-lang.org</a>) together to
report on work being done with the language across the broad
open-source community.  Attendance is open to anyone interested in
Chapel, from the most seasoned Chapel user or developer to someone
simply curious to learn more.
</p>

<p>
<b>Program:</b> This year, the backbone of the workshop will be formed
by talks from members of the Chapel community describing work they are
undertaking within the context of Chapel.  Interested parties are
encouraged to propose talks using the submission process outlined
below.  The selection of speakers and final program will be curated by
the workshop's steering committee.  While speakers are welcome to
prepare a paper to complement their talk, there is no requirement to
do so, nor will there be any formal proceedings for this workshop.
All talk slides, papers, and materials developed for the workshop will
be archived on the workshop website.  Most importantly, presenting
research results at this workshop is not intended to preclude their
submission and publication at more established conferences and
workshops.
</p>

<p>
The day will start with a brief overview of Chapel and the project's
status, for those unfamiliar with the language.  During the workshop,
we also anticipate an invited talk or two, as well as a panel
discussion regarding Chapel's future.  These details will be announced
as we get closer to the workshop date.  At the end of the day, there
will be an open community session to provide a general forum for
hearing questions, thoughts, and feedback from the broader audience.
</p>
