work being done with Chapel, exchange ideas, and forge new
collaborations.  Anyone interested in parallel programming and Chapel
is encouraged to attend CHIUW, from long-term enthusiasts to those
simply curious to learn more.  This year's CHIUW will be online and
there will be no registration fees.

<p>CHIUW 2022 is a full-day, independent, virtual workshop consisting
of participant-driven Coding Day (June 9) and
Chapel-related presentations and sessions (June 10).
Those interested in submitting papers and Coding Day activities
should refer to the Submissions section below.

Other workshop activities will include:

<ul>
<li> A keynote talk by Hal Finkel at the Department of Energy in Advanced
     Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) titled 
     "Community Research Priorities for Next-Generation Scientific Computing"
<li> a pre-workshop introduction to Chapel for those new to the language
<li> a "State of the Chapel Project" talk
<li> a free-form community discussion on Chapel priorities and next steps
</ul>

<p>All participants at CHIUW will be expected to follow the Chapel

<b><big>Submissions</big></b><br>
</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>Submissions to CHIUW 2022 can be made in the following forms:

<ol>
<li> <b>Research papers:</b> 5-8 pages, excluding references<br>
<p>
Research papers can describe novel R&amp;D being undertaken by the
authors, or an update on ongoing efforts that are of interest to Chapel
community. Papers will be evaluated by the program committee using
typical standards for academic research papers, including plagiarism
(and self-plagiarism). Research papers should be prepared using the
<a href = "https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM
conference submission format</a>. We strongly recommend checking that
each line is numbered to ease and enrich the review process.

<p>Acceptance to CHIUW 2022 does not preclude papers from being
published elsewhere, and authors are encouraged to submit their work
to other venues.</p>

<p>
<li> <b>Talk proposals:</b> 1-4 pages, excluding references (if any)<br>
<p>
To propose a talk at CHIUW, submit an extended abstract describing
what you intend to present. CHIUW talks can preview work that is not
yet ready for publication, recap work that the speaker has already
published, and/or describe work that is not intended for
publication. Talk proposals will be evaluated by the program and
steering committees based on their expected level of interest to the
CHIUW audience. Talk proposals should be formatted reasonably where
using the same template as the research papers is an option, though
not a requirement.

<p>
<li> <b>Coding Day activities:</b><br>
<p>

Coding Day is an opportunity to engage with an experienced Chapel
developer such as a member of Chapel's core team on a hands-on coding
task or to gain in-depth experience with some aspect of Chapel.
To apply to participate in Coding Day, please fill out
<a href="https://forms.gle/N9cELg8TibHUgkvJ9">this form</a>
by May 13.
Coding Day applications do not go through EasyChair.

</ol>

Please submit your manuscript for either form via <a href =
"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chiuw2022">EasyChair</a> by
the submission deadline below.

<p>
<a id = "review"></a>
<b><big>Review Process</big></b>
</p>

A single-blind reviewing process will be used for manuscripts.
Conflicts of interest
(COI) will be observed, such as shared affiliations and previous
co-authorships (within the past four years), or advising relationships
(at any time).  PC members will not review a paper whose authors
include someone with whom they have a COI.

</p>

</div>


<p>
<a id = "presenting"></a>
<b><big>Presenting Your Work</big></b>
</p>

<p>Depending on scheduling constraints, each accepted research paper
and talk proposal will get 15-25 minutes of presentation time,
followed by 5 minutes of Q&amp;A. Research papers that are not
accepted for publication at CHIUW 2022 will automatically be
considered as a talk proposal submission, as well. If accepted as
such, authors will have the option to submit a shorter version of
their work for the final version.
Coding Day participants are strongly encouraged to present a short talk
and/or a virtual poster during the second day of CHIUW.
</p>

<p>Accepted submissions will be made available through the CHIUW 2022
website.</p>
