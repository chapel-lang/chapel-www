<h2>Contributing to the Chapel Project</h2>

  <dt><b><big>1. Where to start</big></b></dt>
    <dd>
        Everyone interested in contributing to the Chapel project
        should start from a user's perspective.  If you aren't already
        familiar with the Chapel language, see
        <a href="learning-old.html"><i>How Can I Learn Chapel?</i></a>&nbsp; If
        you don't already have access to a Chapel compiler,
        <a href = "download-old.html">download and install</a> a copy,
        ensuring that you can compile and run example programs.
    </dd>

  <dt><b><big>2. Write a Chapel program of your own</big></b></dt>
    <dd>
        Now that you have a working installation of Chapel, try
        writing your favorite benchmark, test case, or homework
        assignment in Chapel.  This experience may cause you to run
        into something you find poorly documented, a bug, or a
        performance surprise. Filing these as
        <a href="https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/issues">GitHub
        Issues</a> is a great starting point for contributing to the
        project. Sometimes this process will lead you to find issues
        that you can fix yourself, since you're already familiar with
        the problem.

           3. Learn the mechanics of contributing
    </big></b></dt>
    <dd>
        Now that you've written your own Chapel program, familiarize
        yourself with Chapel's
        <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/developer/bestPractices/ContributorInfo.html">contributor guidelines</a>.
        If you want to observe how the development process works, browse (and optionally subscribe to)
        <a href="https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue">GitHub issues</a>
        and <a href="https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr">pull requests</a>.

           4. Find a task to work on
  </big></b></dt>
    <dd>
        Now that you're familiar with Chapel and the process for
        contributing, see if you can find a GitHub issue with the
        <a href="https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/labels/good%20first%20issue">good
        first issue</a> label that you think you can make progress
        on. Alternatively, if you have a feature or improvement to
        Chapel that you'd like to propose (e.g., a new library you'd
        like to provide), open a GitHub issue doing so to get buy-in
        for the effort.  It's OK to ask for help with issues, but
        please see the "Dos and Don'ts" section below first.

        "I want to contribute a library to Chapel, should I open a PR?"
    </big></b></dt>
    <dd>
        No, you should start your library as a
        <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/tools/mason/mason.html"> mason package</a>.
        Introducing a new standard library to be distributed with Chapel is an
        effort that requires significant
        <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/developer/bestPractices/ContributorInfo.html#design">community discussion</a>.
