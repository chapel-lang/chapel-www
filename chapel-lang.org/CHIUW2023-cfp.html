<div class="indent">

<p>
CHIUW 2023 is the 10th annual <a href = "CHIUW.html">Chapel Implementers and
Users Workshop</a>, which serves as a forum where users and developers of the
general-purpose Chapel programming language (<a href =
"https://chapel-lang.org">chapel-lang.org</a>) can meet to report on work being
done with Chapel, exchange ideas, and forge new collaborations. Anyone
interested in parallel programming and/or Chapel is encouraged to attend CHIUW,
from long-term enthusiasts to those simply curious to learn more. This year's
CHIUW will be online and there will be no registration fees.

<p>
CHIUW 2023 is an independent, virtual workshop consisting of hands-on exercises
and participant-driven sessions (Coding Day, June 1st) and Chapel-related
presentations and sessions (Workshop Day, June 2nd). Those interested in
submitting papers and Coding Day activities should refer to the Submissions
section below.

<p>
Other workshop activities will include:

<ul>
  <li> a keynote talk by Paul Hargrove at the Lawrance Berkeley
    National Laboratory&nbsp;(LBNL) titled <i>PGAS Programming Models: My
    20-year Perspective</i>
  <li> a pre-workshop introduction to Chapel for those new to the language 
  <li> a "State of the Chapel Project" talk 
  <li> a free-form community discussion on Chapel priorities and next steps 
</ul>

<p>All participants at CHIUW will be expected to follow the Chapel

<b><big>Submissions</big></b><br>
</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>Submissions to CHIUW 2023 can be made in the following forms:

<ol>
<li> <b>Research papers:</b> 5&ndash;8 pages, excluding references<br>
<p>
Research papers can describe novel R&amp;D being undertaken by the
authors, or an update on ongoing efforts that are of interest to Chapel
community. Papers will be evaluated by the program committee using
typical standards for academic research papers, including plagiarism
(and self-plagiarism). Research papers should be prepared using the
<a href = "https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM
conference submission format</a>. We strongly recommend checking that
each line is numbered to ease and enrich the review process.

<p>
Acceptance to CHIUW 2023 does not preclude papers from being
published elsewhere, and authors are encouraged to submit their work
to other venues.</p>

<p>
<li> <b>Talk proposals:</b> 1&ndash;4 pages, excluding references (if any)<br>
<p>
To propose a talk at CHIUW, submit an extended abstract describing
what you intend to present. CHIUW talks can preview work that is not
yet ready for publication, recap work that the speaker has already
published, and/or describe work that is not intended for
publication. Talk proposals will be evaluated by the program and
steering committees based on their expected level of interest to the
CHIUW audience. Talk proposals should be formatted reasonably, where
using the same template as the research papers is an option, though
not a requirement.

<p>
<li> <b>Coding Day activities:</b><br>
<p>
The CHIUW Coding Day is an opportunity to engage with an experienced Chapel
developer such as a member of Chapel's core team on a hands-on coding task or to
gain in-depth experience with some aspects of Chapel.  Examples include porting
a modest amount of existing code, writing an example distributed parallel
program to process files in parallel, or asking questions about Chapel features
and example codes.
</ol>

<p>
Please submit your research paper or talk proposal via
<a href=https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chiuw2023>EasyChair</a>. To
apply for a Coding Day activity please use 
<a href=https://forms.office.com/r/vUg2kUYa9X>this form</a>.

<b><big>Review Process</big></b>
</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
A single-blind reviewing process will be used for manuscripts.
Conflicts of interest
(COI) will be observed, such as shared affiliations and previous
co-authorships (within the past four years), or advising relationships
(at any time).  PC members will not review a paper whose authors
include someone with whom they have a COI.

</div>

<p>
<a id = "presenting"></a>
<b><big>Presenting Your Work</big></b>
</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Depending on scheduling constraints, each accepted research paper and talk
proposal will have 15&ndash;25 minutes of presentation time, followed by 5 minutes of
Q&amp;A. Research papers that are not accepted for publication at CHIUW 2023 will
automatically be considered as a talk proposal submission. If accepted as such,
authors can submit a shorter version of their work for the final version. Coding
Day participants are strongly encouraged to to give a short summary of their
coding day experience during the second day of CHIUW, as an informal talk or
virtual poster. 
</p>


<p>
Accepted submissions will be made publicly available through the CHIUW 2023
website.
