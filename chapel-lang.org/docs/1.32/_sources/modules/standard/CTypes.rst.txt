**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use CTypes;


or

.. code-block:: chapel

   import CTypes;



Defines C types and related routines to support interoperability.

This module provides access to common C types for the purpose of
calling between Chapel and C, declaring variables using C's types,
etc.  It also contains routines in support of working with C types.

See :ref:`readme-extern`, and :ref:`Chapter-Interoperability` for
additional information about interoperating between Chapel and C (or
other languages).

.. include:: ChapelSysCTypes.rst


.. type:: type c_float = real(32)

   The Chapel type corresponding to the C 'float' type 

.. type:: type c_double = real(64)

   The Chapel type corresponding to the C 'double' type 

.. data:: config param cFileTypeHasPointer = true

   Controls whether :type:`c_FILE` represents a ``FILE*`` or a ``FILE``.
   
   - If true, ``c_FILE`` represents a ``FILE*``. This behavior is deprecated
     and will be removed in an upcoming release.
   - If false, ``c_FILE`` represents a ``FILE``. A ``FILE*`` can still be
     represented with ``c_ptr(c_FILE)``.
   
   The deprecated behavior is on by default. To opt-in to the new behavior,
   recompile your program with ``-scFileTypeHasPointer=false``.
   
   

.. function:: proc c_FILE type

   Chapel type alias for a C ``FILE`` 

.. type:: type c_void_ptr = c_ptr(void)

   
   A Chapel type alias for ``void*`` in C. Casts from integral types to
   ``c_void_ptr`` as well as casts from ``c_void_ptr`` to integral types are
   supported and behave similarly to those operations in C.
   
   

   .. warning::

      c_void_ptr is deprecated, use 'c_ptr(void)' instead.

.. function:: proc c_nil

   A Chapel version of a C NULL pointer. 

   .. warning::

      c_nil is deprecated, use just 'nil' instead.

.. function:: proc is_c_nil(x): bool

   
   :returns: true if the passed value is a NULL pointer (ie 0).
   

   .. warning::

      is_c_nil is deprecated without replacement, as 'c_nil' is deprecated in favor of 'nil'; compare argument to 'nil' directly with ==, casting to c_ptr(void) first if needed.

.. type:: c_ptr : writeSerializable

   
   
   Represents a local C pointer for the purpose of C integration. This type
   represents the equivalent to a C language pointer ``eltType*``. Instances of
   this type support assignment to other instances or ``nil``, ``==`` or ``!=``
   comparison with ``nil``, and casting to another ``c_ptr`` type.
   
   ``c_ptr(void)`` represents an opaque pointer with special functionality,
   corresponding to ``void*`` in C. Casts from integral types to
   ``c_ptr(void)`` as well as casts from ``c_ptr(void)`` to integral types are
   supported and behave similarly to those operations in C. Casting a
   ``c_ptr(void)`` to or from a ``c_ptr(t)`` of any pointee type is allowed.
   
   Casting directly to a ``c_ptr`` of another pointee type is supported, but
   will emit a safety warning for casts that can lead to violation of C's
   strict aliasing rule. Casting to a char pointee type or across signedness,
   or through an intermediate cast to ``c_ptr(void)``, will not generate a
   warning.
   
   As with a Chapel class, a ``c_ptr`` can be tested non-nil simply
   by including it in an if statement conditional, like so:
   
   .. code-block:: chapel
   
     var x: c_ptr = c_ptrTo(...);
     if x then do writeln("x is not nil");
     if !x then do writeln("x is nil");
   
   Additionally, a ``c_ptr`` can be output like so:
   
   .. code-block:: chapel
   
     var x: c_ptr = c_ptrTo(...);
     writeln(x); // outputs nil or e.g. 0xabc123000000
   
   


   .. attribute:: type eltType

      
      The type that this pointer points to, which can be queried like so:
      
      .. code-block:: chapel
      
        var x: c_ptr = c_ptrTo(...);
        if x.eltType == c_int then do writeln("x is an int pointer");
      

   .. method:: proc this(i: integral) ref

      Retrieve the i'th element (zero based) from a pointer to an array.
      Does the equivalent of ptr[i] in C.
      

   .. method:: proc deref() ref

      Get element pointed to directly by this pointer. If the pointer
      refers to an array, this will return ptr[0].
      

   .. method:: proc serialize(writer, ref serializer) throws

      Print this pointer 

.. type:: c_ptrConst : writeSerializable

   
   Like :type:`c_ptr`, but for a pointer to const data. In C, this is
   equivalent to the type `const eltType*`.
   


   .. attribute:: type eltType

      
      The type that this pointer points to, which can be queried like so:
      
      .. code-block:: chapel
      
        var x: c_ptrConst = c_ptrToConst(...);
        if x.eltType == c_int then do writeln("x is a const int pointer");
      

   .. method:: proc this(i: integral) const ref

      Retrieve the i'th element (zero based) from a pointer to an array.
      Does the equivalent of ptr[i] in C.
      Provides a ``const ref`` which cannot be used to modify the element.
      

   .. method:: proc deref() const ref

      Get element pointed to directly by this pointer. If the pointer
      refers to an array, this will return ptr[0].
      Provides a ``const ref`` which cannot be used to modify the element.
      

   .. method:: proc serialize(writer, ref serializer) throws

      Print this pointer 

.. type:: c_array : writeSerializable

   
   This type represents a C array with fixed size.  A variable of type
   ``c_array`` can coerce to a ``c_ptr`` with the same element type.  In that
   event, the pointer will be equivalent to ``c_ptrTo(array[0])``.  A ``c_array``
   behaves similarly to a homogeneous tuple except that its indices start at 0
   and it is guaranteed to be stored in contiguous memory.  A ``c_array``
   variable has value semantics. Declaring one as a function-local variable will
   create the array elements in the function's stack. Assigning or copy
   initializing will result in copying the elements (vs resulting in two pointers
   that refer to the same elements).  A ``nil`` ``c_array`` is not representable
   in Chapel.
   


   .. attribute:: type eltType

      
      The array element type, which can be queried like so:
      
      .. code-block:: chapel
      
        var x: c_array = c_ptrToConst(...);
        if x.eltType == c_int then do writeln("x is an array of ints");
      

   .. attribute:: param size

      
      The fixed number of elements, which can be queried like so:
      
      .. code-block:: chapel
      
        var x: c_array = c_ptrToConst(...);
        writeln("x has ", x.size, " elements.");
      

   .. method:: proc init(type eltType, param size)

   .. method:: proc deinit()

   .. method:: proc ref this(i: integral) ref: eltType

      Retrieve the i'th element (zero based) from the array.
      Does the equivalent of arr[i] in C.
      Includes bounds checking when such checks are enabled.
      

   .. method:: proc ref this(param i: integral) ref: eltType

      As with the previous function, returns the i'th element (zero based)
      from the array. This one emits a compilation error if i is out of bounds.
      

   .. method:: proc serialize(writer, ref serializer) throws

      Print the elements 

   .. method:: proc init=(other: c_array)

.. method:: operator c_array. = (ref lhs: c_array, rhs: c_array)

   Copy the elements from one :type:`c_array` to another.
   Raises an error at compile time if the array sizes or
   element types do not match. 

.. function:: operator  = (ref lhs: c_ptr, ref rhs: c_array)

.. data:: config param cPtrToLogicalValue = false

   
   Toggles whether the new or deprecated behavior of :proc:`c_ptrTo` and
   :proc:`c_ptrToConst` is used for :type:`~String.string`,
   :type:`~Bytes.bytes`, and class type arguments. (The behavior of
   :proc:`c_ptrTo` with array type arguments is unaffected.)
   
   The new behavior is to return a :type:`c_ptr`/:type:`c_ptrConst` to the
   underlying buffer of the ``string`` or ``bytes``, or to the heap instance of
   a class type. The deprecated behavior is to return a
   :type:`c_ptr`/:type:`c_ptrConst` to the ``string`` or ``bytes`` itself, or
   the stack representation of the class â€” this matches the behavior of
   :proc:`c_addrOf`/:proc:`c_addrOfConst`.
   
   The deprecated behavior is on by default. To opt-in to the new behavior,
   compile your program with the following argument:
   ``-s cPtrToLogicalValue=true``.
   

.. function:: proc c_ptrTo(ref x: ?t)

   
   Returns a :type:`c_ptr` to any Chapel object.
   
   For most types, the returned :type:`c_ptr` will simply point to the memory
   address of the Chapel variable, and have element type matching the type of
   the passed-in variable. However, this procedure has special behavior for
   variables of the following types, and will return a pointer that is
   potentially more useful:
   
   * ``array`` types: Returns a pointer to the first element of the array, with
     pointer element type matching the array's element type.
   * ``class`` types: Returns a ``c_ptr(void)`` to the heap instance of the
     class variable.
   * ``string`` type: Returns a ``c_ptr(c_uchar)`` to the underlying buffer of
     the ``string``.
   * ``bytes`` type: Returns a ``c_ptr(c_uchar)`` to the underlying buffer of
     the ``bytes``.
   
   To avoid this special behavior and just get the variable address naively
   regardless of type, use :proc:`c_addrOf` instead. ``c_ptrTo`` has identical
   behavior to ``c_addrOf`` on types other than those with special behavior
   listed above.
   
   .. note::
   
     The existence of the ``c_ptr`` has no impact on the lifetime
     of the object it points to. In many cases the object will be stack
     allocated and could go out of scope even if this ``c_ptr`` remains.
   
   :arg x:   The by-reference argument to get a pointer to. Domains are not
             supported, and will cause a compiler error.
   :returns: A :type:`c_ptr` to the argument passed by reference, with address
             and element type potentially depending on special behavior for the
             the type as described above.
   
   

.. function:: proc c_ptrTo(ref s: string): c_ptr(string) where cPtrToLogicalValue == false

   .. warning::

      The c_ptrTo(string) overload that returns a c_ptr(string) is deprecated. Please use 'c_addrOf' instead, or recompile with '-s cPtrToLogicalValue=true' to opt-in to the new behavior.

.. function:: proc c_ptrTo(ref b: bytes): c_ptr(bytes) where cPtrToLogicalValue == false

   .. warning::

      The c_ptrTo(bytes) overload that returns a c_ptr(bytes) is deprecated. Please use 'c_addrOf' instead, or recompile with '-s cPtrToLogicalValue=true' to opt-in to the new behavior.

.. function:: proc c_ptrTo(ref c: class?): c_ptr(c.type) where cPtrToLogicalValue == false

   .. warning::

      The c_ptrTo(class) overload that returns a pointer to the class representation on the stack is deprecated. Default behavior will soon change to return a pointer to the heap instance. Please use 'c_addrOf' instead, or recompile with '-s cPtrToLogicalValue=true' to opt-in to the new behavior.

.. function:: proc c_ptrToConst(const ref x: ?t): c_ptrConst(t)

   
   Like :proc:`c_ptrTo`, but returns a :type:`c_ptrConst` which disallows direct
   modification of the pointee.
   

.. function:: proc c_addrOf(ref x: ?t): c_ptr(t)

   
   Returns a :type:`c_ptr` to the address of any Chapel object.
   
   Note that the behavior of this procedure is identical to :proc:`c_ptrTo`
   for scalar types and records. It only differs for arrays, strings, bytes,
   and class variables; see documentation of :proc:`c_ptrTo` for special
   behavior on those types.
   

.. function:: proc c_addrOfConst(const ref x: ?t): c_ptrConst(t)

   
   Like :proc:`c_addrOf`, but returns a :type:`c_ptrConst` which disallows
   direct modification of the pointee.
   

.. function:: proc c_sizeof(type t): c_size_t

   
   Return the size in bytes of a type, as with the C ``sizeof`` built-in.
   
   .. warning::
   
     This method is intended for C interoperability. To enhance
     flexibility, it is possible to request the sizes of Chapel types.
     However, be aware:
   
        * Chapel types are not necessarily stored in contiguous memory
        * Behavior of ``c_sizeof`` with Chapel types may change
        * Behavior given a Chapel class type is not well-defined
   

.. function:: proc c_offsetof(type t, param fieldname: string): c_size_t where isRecordType(t)

   
   Return the offset of a field in a record.
   
   .. warning::
   
     This method is intended for C interoperability.  To enhance flexibility,
     it is possible to request the offset of elements within a Chapel record.
     However, be aware:
   
     * Chapel types are not necessary stored in contiguous memory
     * Behavior of ``c_offsetof`` may change
     * Behavior given a Chapel class type field is not well-defined
   

.. function:: proc allocate(type eltType, size: c_size_t, clear: bool = false, alignment: c_size_t = 0): c_ptr(eltType)

   Allocate memory.
   
    This uses the Chapel allocator. Memory allocated with this function should
    eventually be freed with :proc:`deallocate`.
   
   :arg eltType: the type of the elements to allocate
   :arg size: the number of elements to allocate space for
   :arg clear: whether to initialize all bits of allocated memory to 0
   :arg alignment: Memory alignment of the allocation, which must be a power of
                   two and a multiple of `c_sizeof(c_ptr(void))`. Alignment of 0
                   is invalid and taken to mean default alignment.
   :returns: a c_ptr(eltType) to allocated memory
   

   .. warning::

      'allocate' is unstable, and may be renamed or moved

.. function:: proc deallocate(data: c_ptr(void))

   Free memory that was allocated with :proc:`allocate`.
   
   :arg data: the c_ptr to memory that was allocated. Note that both
              `c_ptr(t)` and `c_ptr(void)` can be passed to this argument.
   

   .. warning::

      'deallocate' is unstable, and may be renamed or moved

.. function:: proc c_calloc(type eltType, size: integral): c_ptr(eltType)

   
   Allocate memory and initialize all bits to 0. Note that this simply zeros
   memory, it does not call Chapel initializers (it is meant for primitive
   types and C interoperability only.) This memory should eventually be freed
   with :proc:`c_free`.
   
   :arg eltType: the type of the elements to allocate
   :arg size: the number of elements to allocate space for
   :returns: a c_ptr(eltType) to allocated memory
   

   .. warning::

      'c_calloc' is deprecated; use ':proc:`allocate`' with 'clear' argument

.. function:: proc c_malloc(type eltType, size: integral): c_ptr(eltType)

   
   Allocate memory that is not initialized. This memory should eventually be
   freed with :proc:`c_free`.
   
   :arg eltType: the type of the elements to allocate
   :arg size: the number of elements to allocate space for
   :returns: a c_ptr(eltType) to allocated memory
   

   .. warning::

      'c_malloc' is deprecated; use ':proc:`allocate`'

.. function:: proc c_aligned_alloc(type eltType, alignment: integral, size: integral): c_ptr(eltType)

   
   Allocate aligned memory that is not initialized. This memory
   should be eventually freed with :proc:`c_free`.
   
   This function is intended to behave similarly to the C17
   function aligned_alloc.
   
   :arg eltType: the type of the elements to allocate
   :arg alignment: the memory alignment of the allocation
                   which must be a power of two and a multiple
                   of ``c_sizeof(c_ptr(void))``.
   :arg size: the number of elements to allocate space for
   :returns: a ``c_ptr(eltType)`` to allocated memory
   

   .. warning::

      'c_aligned_alloc' is deprecated; use ':proc:`allocate`' with 'alignment' argument

.. function:: proc c_free(data: c_ptr(void))

   Free memory that was allocated with :proc:`c_calloc` or :proc:`c_malloc`.
   
   :arg data: the c_ptr to memory that was allocated. Note that both
              `c_ptr(t)` and `c_ptr(void)` can be passed to this argument.
   

   .. warning::

      'c_free' is deprecated; use ':proc:`deallocate`'

.. function:: proc isAnyCPtr(type t) param

   
   Returns true if t is a c_ptr, c_ptrConst, or c_ptr(void) type.
   

   .. warning::

      isAnyCPtr is deprecated

.. function:: proc c_memmove(dest: c_ptr(void), const src: c_ptr(void), n: integral)

   
   Copies n potentially overlapping bytes from memory area src to memory
   area dest.
   
   This is a simple wrapper over the C ``memmove()`` function.
   
   :arg dest: the destination memory area to copy to
   :arg src: the source memory area to copy from
   :arg n: the number of bytes from src to copy to dest
   

   .. warning::

      :proc:`c_memmove` is deprecated; please use :proc:`POSIX.memmove` instead

.. function:: proc c_memcpy(dest: c_ptr(void), const src: c_ptr(void), n: integral)

   
   Copies n non-overlapping bytes from memory area src to memory
   area dest. Use :proc:`c_memmove` if memory areas do overlap.
   
   This is a simple wrapper over the C memcpy() function.
   
   :arg dest: the destination memory area to copy to
   :arg src: the source memory area to copy from
   :arg n: the number of bytes from src to copy to dest
   

   .. warning::

      :proc:`c_memcpy` is deprecated; please use :proc:`POSIX.memcpy` instead

.. function:: proc c_memcmp(const s1: c_ptr(void), const s2: c_ptr(void), n: integral)

   
   Compares the first n bytes of memory areas s1 and s2
   
   This is a simple wrapper over the C ``memcmp()`` function.
   
   :returns: returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if
             the first n bytes of s1 are found, respectively, to be less than,
             to match, or be greater than the first n bytes of s2.
   

   .. warning::

      :proc:`c_memcmp` is deprecated; please use :proc:`POSIX.memcmp` instead

.. function:: proc c_memset(s: c_ptr(void), c: integral, n: integral)

   
   Fill bytes of memory with a particular byte value.
   
   This is a simple wrapper over the C ``memset()`` function.
   
   :arg s: the destination memory area to fill
   :arg c: the byte value to use
   :arg n: the number of bytes of s to fill
   
   :returns: s
   

   .. warning::

      :proc:`c_memset` is deprecated; please use :proc:`POSIX.memset` instead

.. function:: proc strLen(x: c_ptr(?t)): int

   
   Get the number of bytes in a c_ptr(int(8)) or c_ptr(uint(8)), excluding the
   terminating null.
   
   :arg x: c_ptr(int(8)) or c_ptr(uint(8)) to get length of
   
   :returns: the number of bytes in x, excluding the terminating null
   

   .. warning::

      the strLen function is unstable and may change or go away in a future release

   Get the number of bytes in a c_ptrConst(int(8)) or c_ptrConst(uint(8)),
   excluding the terminating NULL.

   .. warning::

      the strLen function is unstable and may change or go away in a future release

.. method:: proc string.c_str(): c_ptrConst(c_char)

   
   Get a `c_ptrConst(c_char)` from a :type:`~String.string`. The returned
   `c_ptrConst(c_char)` shares the buffer with the :type:`~String.string`.
   
   .. warning::
   
       This can only be called safely on a :type:`~String.string` whose home is
       the current locale.  This property can be enforced by calling
       :proc:`~String.string.localize()` before :proc:`string.c_str()`.
       If the string is remote, the program will halt.
   
   For example:
   
   .. code-block:: chapel
   
     var myString = "Hello!";
     on differentLocale {
       writef("%s", myString.localize().c_str());
     }
   
   .. warning::
   
       A Chapel :type:`~String.string` is capable of containing NULL characters
       and any C routines relying on NULL terminated buffers may incorrectly
       process the mid-string NULL as the terminating NULL.
   
   :returns:
       A `c_ptrConst(c_char)` that points to the underlying buffer used by this
       :type:`~String.string`. The returned `c_ptrConst(c_char)` is only valid
       when used on the same locale as the string.
