The ``OS`` module provides definitions matching operating system
interfaces.

This module provides Chapel declarations for the constants, types,
and functions defined by various operating systems' programmatic
interfaces.  It is not complete for any operating system, but does
define those things that have been needed so far in implementing
other Chapel modules and user programs.  It is expected to grow as
needed.  In all respects (naming, capitalization, types, semantics)
the symbols defined here should match their corresponding operating
system definitions to the extent Chapel can do so.  For documentation
on these symbols, please see the operating system manual pages.
