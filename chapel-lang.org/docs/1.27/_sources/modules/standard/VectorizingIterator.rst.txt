VectorizingIterator
===================
**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use VectorizingIterator;


or

.. code-block:: chapel

   import VectorizingIterator;



Iterators supporting vectorization without creating tasks.

Data parallel constructs (such as ``forall`` loops) are implicitly
vectorizable. If the ``--vectorize`` compiler flag is thrown the Chapel
compiler will emit vectorization hints to the backend compiler, though the
effects will vary based on the target compiler.

In order to allow users to explicitly request vectorization, this prototype
vectorizing iterator is being provided. Loops that invoke this iterator will
be marked with vectorization hints, provided the ``--vectorize`` flag is
thrown.

This iterator is currently available for all Chapel programs and does not
require a ``use`` statement to make it available. In future releases it will
be moved to a standard module and will likely require a ``use`` statement to
make it available.


.. warning::

   The 'VectorizingIterator' module has been deprecated; please use 'foreach' loops instead
