Support for pseudorandom number generation.

This module defines a :record:`randomStream` type (based upon the PCG
algorithm) that can be used to generate pseudorandom numbers in parallel.
The ``randomStream`` type can be used to generate individual random numbers
via :proc:`randomStream.getNext` or to fill an array with random numbers via
:proc:`randomStream.fill`. There are also several other methods available
for manipulating arrays, parallel iteration, or adjusting the stream's
position.

This module contains a few top-level procedures that can be used for
manipulating arrays:

* :proc:`fillRandom` fills an array with random numbers in parallel
* :proc:`shuffle` randomly re-arranges the elements of an array
* :proc:`permutation` creates a random permutation of an array's domain (*unstable*).

Seed Generation
---------------

The :record:`randomStream` type can be initialized with a seed value.
When not provided explicitly, a seed will be generated in an
implementation specific manner based on the current time. This behavior
is currently unstable and may change in the future.

Additionally, the standalone methods in this module that generate their
own seed values are currently unstable.

Prior to Chapel 1.33, seed values could be generated with the now
deprecated ``RandomSupport.SeedGenerator`` type. For a non-deprecated
replacement, see :proc:`~NPBRandom.oddTimeSeed`. Note that the
``NPBRandom`` module is not stable.


Note About Deprecations and Future Work
---------------------------------------

Before Chapel 1.33, this module was unstable. It defined an abstract
random stream interface (:class:`RandomStreamInterface`) and two
implementations of that interface (based on the PCG and NPB algorithms).

As of Chapel 1.33, this module is partially stable and defines a single
:record:`randomStream` type that is based on the PCG algorithm. The
NPB algorithm is still available via the :mod:`NPBRandom` package module.
The ``RandomStreamInterface`` is now deprecated.

Various symbols used to switch between the two algorithms have also been
deprecated. These include:

* :proc:`createRandomStream`
* :type:`RNG`
* :param:`defaultRNG`
* :type:`RandomStream`
* overloads of the top-level methods that accept an ``algorithm`` argument

In a future release, we intend to use Chapel's interface features to
define one or more interfaces for random streams. At that point, the
:record:`randomStream` type will be an implementation of the interface(s)
for generating a seedable stream of random numbers.

.. record:: randomStream : writeSerializable

   
   A :record:`randomStream` represents a stream of pseudorandom numbers of a
   particular type. Numeric and bool types are supported.
   
   Conceptually it can be thought of as an indexed sequence of numbers ranging
   from 0 to infinity. Each index in the sequence corresponds to a random
   number of the specified type. This allows for the generation of random
   numbers in parallel, where each task involved in the parallel iteration can
   request random numbers within a particular range and traverse that range of
   the sequence independently of other tasks (see :proc:`randomStream.iterate`
   (*unstable*)).
   
   Although parallel iteration is supported via the ``iterate`` method, the
   type itself is not thread-safe. In particular, it is not safe to call
   methods such as ``getNext`` or ``fill`` on a ``randomStream`` from multiple
   tasks concurrently.
   
   Several high-level methods are provided to generate random numbers or
   to manipulate arrays using random numbers:
   
       * :proc:`randomStream.fill` to fill an array with random numbers
       * :proc:`randomStream.shuffle` to randomly re-arrange the elements of an
         array
       * :proc:`randomStream.permutation` to create a random permutation of
         an arrays domain, and store it in the array (*unstable*)
       * :proc:`randomStream.choice` to randomly sample from an array or
         range (*unstable*)
   
   Note that these methods have top-level counterparts that will internally
   create a ``randomStream`` and then call the corresponding method on it. These
   can be convenient for one-off uses, but if you are generating many random
   numbers, it is generally more efficient to create a ``randomStream`` and use
   it repeatedly.
   
   An individual random number can be requested using :proc:`randomStream.getNext`
   which will advance the stream to the next position and return the value at
   that position. The position of the stream can also be manipulated using:
   
     * :proc:`randomStream.skipToNth` to skip to a particular position in the
       stream
     * :proc:`randomStream.getNth` to skip to a particular position in the
       stream and return the value at that position (*unstable*)
   
   A ``randomStream`` can be initialized with a seed value. When not provided
   explicitly, a seed will be generated in an implementation specific manner
   that depends upon the current time (*this behavior is currently unstable*).
   
   When copied, the ``randomStream``'s seed, state, and position will also be
   copied. This means that the copy will produce the same sequence of random
   numbers as the original without affecting the original.
   
   .. note:: **Implementation Details:**
   
     This stream is implemented using the PCG random number generator algorithm.
     See http://www.pcg-random.org/ and the paper, `PCG: A Family
     of Simple Fast Space-Efficient Statistically Good Algorithms for Random
     Number Generation` by M.E. O'Neill.
   
     This record builds upon the :record:`~PCGRandomLib.pcg_setseq_64_xsh_rr_32_rng`
     PCG RNG which has 64 bits of state and 32 bits of output.
   
     While the PCG RNG used here is believed to have good statistical
     properties, it is not suitable for generating key material for encryption
     since the output of this RNG may be predictable.
     Additionally, if statistical properties of the random numbers are very
     important, another strategy may be required.
   
     We have good confidence that the random numbers generated by this record
     match the C PCG reference implementation and have specifically verified
     equal output given the same seed. However, this implementation differs
     from the C PCG reference implementation in how it produces random integers
     within particular bounds (with :proc:`randomStream.getNext` using ``min``
     and ``max`` arguments). In addition, this implementation directly supports
     the generation of random ``real`` values, unlike the C PCG implementation.
   
     Smaller numbers, such as ``uint(8)`` or ``uint(16)``, are generated from
     the high-order bits of the 32-bit output.
   
     To generate larger numbers, several 32-bit-output RNGs are composed
     together. Each of these 32-bit RNGs has a different sequence constant and
     so will be independent and uncorrelated. For example, to generate 128-bit
     complex numbers, this RNG will use four 32-bit PCG RNGs with different
     sequence constants. One impact of this approach is that this implementation
     will only generate 2**64 different complex numbers with a given seed
     (for example).
   
     This record also supports generating integers within particular bounds.
     When that is required, it uses a strategy different from the PCG
     reference implementation to support efficient parallel iteration. In
     particular, when more than 1 random value is required as part of
     generating a value in a range, conceptually it uses more composed
     RNGs (as with the 32x2 strategy). Each new value beyond the first that
     is computed will be computed with a different RNG. This strategy is meant
     to avoid statistical bias. While we have tested this strategy to our
     satisfaction, it has not been subject to rigorous analysis and may
     have undesirable statistical properties.
   
     When generating a real, imaginary, or complex number, this implementation
     uses the strategy of generating a 64-bit unsigned integer and then
     multiplying it by 2.0**-64 in order to convert it to a floating point
     number. While this does construct a uniform distribution on rounded
     floating point values, it leaves out many possible real values (for
     example, 2**-128). We believe that this strategy has reasonable
     statistical properties. One side effect of this strategy is that the real
     number 1.0 can be generated because of rounding. The real number 0.0 can
     be generated because PCG can produce the value 0 as a random integer.
   
     We have tested this implementation with TestU01 (available at
     http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/testu01/tu01.html ).  We measured our
     implementation with TestU01 1.2.3 and the Crush suite, which consists of
     144 statistical tests. The results were:
   
      * no failures for generating uniform reals
      * 1 failure for generating 32-bit values (which is also true for the
        reference version of PCG with the same configuration)
      * 0 failures for generating 64-bit values (which we provided to TestU01
        as 2 different 32-bit values since it only accepts 32 bits at a time)
      * 0 failures for generating bounded integers (which we provided to
        TestU01 by requesting values in [0..,2**31+2**30+1) until we
        had two values < 2**31, removing the top 0 bit, and then combining
        the top 16 bits into the value provided to TestU01).

   .. method:: proc ref getNext(): eltType

      
      Get the next value in the random stream and advance its position by one.
      

   .. method:: proc ref getNext(min: eltType, max: eltType): eltType

      
      Get the next random value from the stream within a given range. Returns
      a number in [``min``, ``max``] (inclusive).
      
      This method will halt if checks are enabled and ``min > max``.

        For integers, this type uses a strategy for generating a value
        in a particular range that has not been subject to rigorous
        study and may have statistical problems.
      
        For real numbers, this type generates a random value in [max, min]
        by computing a random value in [0,1] and scaling and shifting that
        value. Note that not all possible floating point values in
        the interval [`min`, `max`] can be constructed in this way.

   Constructs a new stream of random numbers using the specified seed
   and parallel safety.  Ensures that the seed value meets the PRNG's
   constraints.

.. class:: RandomStreamInterface : writeSerializable

   .. warning::

      'RandomStreamInterface' is deprecated

   
   
   Models a stream of pseudorandom numbers.  This class is defined for
   documentation purposes and should not be instantiated. See
   :mod:`PCGRandom` and :mod:`NPBRandom` for RNGs that can be
   instantiated. To create a random stream, use :proc:`createRandomStream`.
   
   .. note::
   
     At present, different implementations of this interface can vary in
     whether or not they can generate 0.0 and/or 1.0.  (e.g. They can be
     generated by :mod:`PCGRandom` but not by :mod:`NPBRandom`).
   
   .. note::
   
     We plan to support general serial and parallel iterator methods on
     :class:`RandomStreamInterface`; however, providing the full suite of
     iterators is not possible with our current parallel iterator framework.
     Specifically, if :class:`RandomStreamInterface` is a follower in a
     zippered iteration context, there is no way for it to update the total
     number of random numbers generated in a safe/sane/coordinated way.  We are
     exploring a revised leader-follower iterator framework that would support
     this idiom (and other cursor-based ones).  With Chapel's recent support
     for standalone parallel iterators, one could define a standalone parallel
     iterator for :class:`RandomStreamInterface`, but this effort has not yet
     been taken on.
   
   .. note::
   
    The :class:`RandomStreamInterface` is included here only for documentation
    and does not help with compilation in any way.  In the future, we hope to
    turn it into an interface.
   
   

   .. attribute:: type eltType = real(64)

      
      Specifies the type of value generated by the RandomStream.
      Not all RandomStream implementations support all types.
      

   .. attribute:: param parSafe: bool = true

      
      Indicates whether or not the RandomStream needs to be
      parallel-safe by default.  If multiple tasks interact with it in
      an uncoordinated fashion, this must be set to `true`.  If it will
      only be called from a single task, or if only one task will call
      into it at a time, setting to `false` will reduce overhead related
      to ensuring mutual exclusion.
      

   .. attribute:: const seed: int(64)

      
      The seed value for the PRNG.  There may be constraints upon
      legal values depending on the specific RNG.
      

   .. method:: proc getNext(): eltType

      
      Returns the next value in the random stream.

   .. method:: proc skipToNth(n: integral) throws

      
      Advances/rewinds the stream to the `n`-th value in the sequence.
      The first value corresponds to n=0.  n must be >= 0, otherwise an
      IllegalArgumentError is thrown.
      
      :arg n: The position in the stream to skip to.  Must be >= 0.

   .. method:: proc getNth(n: integral): eltType throws

      
      Advance/rewind the stream to the `n`-th value and return it
      (advancing the stream by one).  n must be >= 0, otherwise an
      IllegalArgumentError is thrown.  This is equivalent to
      :proc:`skipToNth()` followed by :proc:`getNext()`.
      
      :arg n: The position in the stream to skip to.  Must be >= 0.

      Fill the argument array with pseudorandom values.  This method is
      identical to the standalone :proc:`fillRandom` procedure,
      except that it consumes random values from the
      :class:`RandomStreamInterface` object on which it's invoked rather
      than creating a new stream for the purpose of the call.
