**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use Map;


or

.. code-block:: chapel

   import Map;

Provides Chapel's standard ``map`` type for key-value storage.

This module contains the implementation of the ``map`` type which is a
container that stores key-value associations.

.. record:: map : serializable

   
   Chapel's standard ``map`` type for key-value storage.
   
   Maps are not parallel safe by default, but can be made parallel safe by
   setting the param formal ``parSafe`` to true in any ``map`` constructor. When
   constructed from another ``map``, the new ``map`` will inherit the parallel safety
   mode of its originating map. Note that the ``parSafe`` mode is currently
   unstable and will eventually be replaced by a standalone parallel-safe map
   type.
   

   .. attribute:: type keyType

      Type of map keys. 

   .. attribute:: type valType

      Type of map values. 

   .. attribute:: param parSafe = false

      .. warning::

         'map.parSafe' is unstable and is expected to be replaced by a separate map type in the future

   .. attribute:: const resizeThreshold = defaultHashTableResizeThreshold

      
      Fractional value that specifies how full this map can be
      before requesting additional memory. The default value of
      0.5 means that the map will not resize until the map is more
      than 50% full. The acceptable values for this argument are
      between 0 and 1, exclusive, meaning (0,1). This is useful
      when you would like to reduce memory impact or potentially
      speed up how fast the map finds a slot. To override the
      default value of 0.5, the `defaultHashTableResizeThreshold`
      config flag can be set at runtime. Note that this default
      affects all hash-based data structures, including
      associative domains and sets.
      

   .. method:: proc init(type keyType, type valType, resizeThreshold = defaultHashTableResizeThreshold, initialCapacity = 16)

      
      Initializes an empty map containing keys and values of given types.
      
      :arg keyType: The type of the keys of this map.
      :arg valType: The type of the values of this map.
      :arg resizeThreshold: Fractional value that specifies how full this map
                            can be before requesting additional memory.
      :arg initialCapacity: Integer value that specifies starting map size. The
                            map can hold at least this many values before
                            attempting to resize.
      

   .. method:: proc init(type keyType, type valType, param parSafe, resizeThreshold = defaultHashTableResizeThreshold, initialCapacity = 16)

      .. warning::

         'map.parSafe' is unstable and is expected to be replaced by a separate map type in the future

      
      Initializes an empty map containing keys and values of given types.
      
      :arg keyType: The type of the keys of this map.
      :arg valType: The type of the values of this map.
      :arg parSafe: If `true`, this map will use parallel safe operations.
      :arg resizeThreshold: Fractional value that specifies how full this map
                            can be before requesting additional memory.
      :arg initialCapacity: Integer value that specifies starting map size. The
                            map can hold at least this many values before
                            attempting to resize.
      

   .. method:: proc init=(ref other: map(?kt, ?vt, ?ps))

      
      Initializes a map containing elements that are copy initialized from
      the elements contained in another map.
      
      :arg other: The map to initialize from.
      :type other: map
      
      :arg parSafe: If `true`, this map will use parallel safe operations.
      :type parSafe: bool
      

   .. method:: proc ref clear()

      
      Clears the contents of this map.
      
      .. warning::
      
        Clearing the contents of this map will invalidate all existing
        references to the elements contained in this map.
      

   .. method:: proc size

      
      The current number of keys contained in this map.
      

   .. method:: proc isEmpty(): bool

      
      Returns `true` if this map contains zero keys.
      
      :returns: `true` if this map is empty.
      :rtype: `bool`
      

   .. method:: proc contains(const k: keyType): bool

      
      Returns `true` if the given key is a member of this map, and `false`
      otherwise.
      
      :arg k: The key to test for membership.
      :type k: keyType
      
      :returns: Whether or not the given key is a member of this map.
      :rtype: `bool`
      

   .. method:: proc ref extend(ref m: map(keyType, valType, parSafe))

      
      Extends this map with the contents of the other, overwriting the values
      for already-existing keys.
      
      :arg m: The other map
      :type m: map(keyType, valType)
      

   .. method:: proc update(const ref k: keyType, updater) throws

      
      Update a value in this map in a parallel safe manner via an updater
      object.
      
      The updater object passed to the `update()` method must define a
      `this()` method that takes two arguments: the first has this map's
      `keyType`, and the second has this map's `valType`.
      
      The updater object's `this()` method must return some sort of value.
      Updater objects that do not need to return anything may
      return `none`.
      
      If the updater object's `this()` method throws, the thrown error will
      be propagated out of `update()`.
      
      :arg k: The key to update
      :type k: `keyType`
      
      :arg updater: A class or record used to update the value at `i`
      
      :throws KeyNotFoundError: if `k` not in map
      
      :return: What the updater returns
      

   .. method:: proc ref this(k: keyType) ref where isDefaultInitializable(valType)

      
      If the key exists in the map, get a reference to the value mapped
      to the given key. If the key does not exist in the map, the value
      type is default initializable, and this proc is called in an attempt
      to modify the map, then the mapping is added and a reference to
      that value is returned. If the key does not exist in the map and
      either the value type is not default initializable or this proc
      is called without attempting to modify the map, then an error will
      be thrown.
      
      :arg k: The key to access
      :type k: keyType
      
      :throws KeyNotFoundError: if `k` is not in map and either `valType`
              is not default initializable or this proc is not called
              in an attempt to modify the map.
      
      :returns: Reference to the value mapped to the given key.

   .. method:: proc get(k: keyType, const sentinel: valType)

      Get a copy of the element stored at position `k` or a sentinel
       value if an element at position `k` does not exist.

      :arg sentinel: The value to return if the map does not contain an
                     entry at position `k`
      
      :returns: A copy of the value at position `k` or a sentinel value
                if the map does not have an entry at position `k`

   .. method:: proc ref getAndRemove(k: keyType)

      Remove the element at position `k` from the map and return its value
