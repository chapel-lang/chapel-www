Regex
=====
**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use Regex;


or

.. code-block:: chapel

   import Regex;



Regular expression support.

The regular expression support is built on top of the RE2 regular expression
library. As such, the exact regular expression syntax available is the syntax
from RE2, which is available within the RE2 project at
https://github.com/google/re2 and included here for your convenience.


Enabling Regular Expression Support
-----------------------------------

Setting the environment variable CHPL_RE2 to bundled will enable regular
expression support with the RE2 library:

.. code-block:: sh

   export CHPL_RE2=bundled

Then, rebuild Chapel. The RE2 library will be expanded from a release included
in the Chapel distribution.

.. note::

  if re2 support is not enabled (which is the case in quickstart configurations
  as in :ref:`chapelhome-quickstart`), the functionality described below will
  result in either a compile-time or a run-time error.


Using Regular Expression Support
--------------------------------

Chapel supports both string and bytes regular expressions.

.. code-block:: chapel

   use Regex;
   var myRegex = new regex("a+");   // b"a+" for matching arbitrary bytes values

Now you can use these methods on regular expressions: :proc:`regex.search`,
:proc:`regex.match`, :proc:`regex.split`, :proc:`regex.matches`.

Lastly, you can include regular expressions in the format string for
:proc:`~FormattedIO.readf` for searching on QIO channels using the ``%/<regex>/``
syntax.

Regular Expression Examples
---------------------------

``a+``
 Match one or more ``a`` characters

``[[:space:]]*`` or ``\s*`` (which would be ``"\\s*"`` in a string)
 Match zero or more spaces

``[[:digit:]]+`` or ``\d+`` (which would be ``"\\d+"`` in a string)
 Match one or more digits

``([a-zA-Z0-9]+[[:space:]]+=[[:space:]]+[0-9]+``
 Match sequences of the form *<letters-and-digits> <spaces>* ``=`` *<digits>*

Regular Expression Types and Methods
------------------------------------

 

.. class:: BadRegexError : Error

   Error thrown if a regular expression fails to compile 

.. record:: regexMatch

   The regexMatch record records a regular expression search match
   or a capture group.
   
   Regular expression search routines normally return one of these.
   Also, this type can be passed as a capture group argument.
   Lastly, something of type regexMatch can be checked for a match
   in a simple if statement, as in:
   
   .. code-block:: chapel
   
     var m:regexMatch = ...;
     if m then do_something_if_matched();
     if !m then do_something_if_not_matched();
   

   .. attribute:: var matched: bool

      true if the regular expression search matched successfully 

   .. attribute:: var byteOffset: byteIndex

      0-based offset into the string or channel that matched; -1 if matched=false 

   .. attribute:: var numBytes: int

      the length of the match. 0 if matched==false 

.. method:: proc string.this(m: regexMatch)

   This function extracts the part of a string matching a regular
   expression or capture group. This method is intended to be
   called on the same string used as the `text` in a regular
   expression search.
   
   :arg m: a match (e.g. returned by :proc:`regex.search`)
   :returns: the portion of ``this`` referred to by the match
   

.. method:: proc bytes.this(m: regexMatch)

   This function extracts the part of a bytes matching a regular
   expression or capture group. This method is intended to be
   called on the same bytes used as the `text` in a regular
   expression search.
   
   :arg m: a match (e.g. returned by :proc:`regex.search`)
   :returns: the portion of ``this`` referred to by the match
   

.. record:: regex : serializable

   This record represents a compiled regular expression. Regular expressions
   are currently cached on a per-thread basis and are reference counted.
   
   A string-based regex can be cast to a string (resulting in the pattern that
   was compiled). A string can be cast to a string-based regex (resulting in a
   compiled regex). Same applies for bytes.
   

   .. method:: proc init(pattern: ?t, posix = false, literal = false, noCapture = false, ignoreCase = false, multiLine = false, dotAll = false, nonGreedy = false) throws where t == string || t == bytes

      
      Initializer for a compiled regular expression. ``new regex()`` throws a
      :class:`BadRegexError` if compilation failed.
      
      :arg pattern: the regular expression to compile. This argument can be
                    string or bytes. See :ref:`regular-expression-syntax` for
                    details.  Note that you may have to escape backslashes. For
                    example, to get the regular expression ``\s``, you'd have to
                    write ``"\\s"`` because the ``\`` is the escape character
                    within Chapel string/bytes literals. Note that, Chapel
                    supports triple-quoted raw string/bytes literals, which do
                    not require escaping backslashes. For example ``"""\s"""`` or
                    ``b"""\s"""`` can be used.
      :arg posix: (optional) set to true to disable non-POSIX regular expression
                  syntax
      :arg literal: (optional) set to true to treat the regular expression as a
                    literal (ie, create a regex matching ``pattern`` as a string
                    rather than as a regular expression).
      :arg noCapture: (optional) set to true in order to disable all capture
                      groups in the regular expression
      :arg ignoreCase: (optional) set to true in order to ignore case when
                       matching. Note that this can be set inside the regular
                       expression with ``(?i)``.
      :arg multiLine: (optional) set to true in order to activate multiline mode
                      (meaning that ``^`` and ``$`` match the beginning and end
                      of a line instead of just the beginning and end of the
                      text.  Note that this can be set inside a regular
                      expression with ``(?m)``.
      :arg dotAll: (optional) set to true in order to allow ``.``
                  to match a newline. Note that this can be set inside the
                  regular expression with ``(?s)``.
      :arg nonGreedy: (optional) set to true in order to prefer shorter matches
                      for repetitions; for example, normally x* will match as
                      many x characters as possible and x*? will match as few as
                      possible.  This flag swaps the two, so that x* will match
                      as few as possible and x*? will match as many as possible.
                      Note that this flag can be set inside the regular
                      expression with ``(?U)``.
      
      :throws BadRegexError: If the argument 'pattern' has syntactical errors.
                             Refer to https://github.com/google/re2/blob/master/re2/re2.h
                             for more details about error codes.
      

   .. method:: proc init=(x: regex(?))

      Creates a new :type:`regex` with the same pattern as ``x``. 

   .. method:: proc init(type exprType)

      
      Default type initializer for a compiled regular expression. This does not
      initialize any fields and the resulting :type:`regex` may produce erroneous
      results when used. The behavior may differ based on values of
      :param:`~ChplConfig.CHPL_COMM`.
      
      .. note::
         If you are looking to default initialize a :type:`regex`, you might be
         looking for ``new regex("")``, which will create a regular expression
         matching the empty string.
      

   .. method:: proc search(text: exprType, ref captures ...?k): regexMatch

      
      Search within the passed text for the first match at any offset to this
      regular expression.  This routine will try matching the regular expression
      at different offsets until a match is found. If you want to only match at
      the beginning of the pattern, you can start your pattern with ``^`` and
      end it with ``$`` or use :proc:`regex.match`. If a capture group was not
      matched, the corresponding argument will get the default value for its
      type.
      
      :arg text: a string or bytes to search
      :arg captures: (optional) what to capture from the regular expression.
                     If the class:`regex` was based on string, then, these
                     should be strings or types that strings can cast to. Same
                     applies for bytes.
      :returns: an :record:`regexMatch` object representing the offset in text
                where a match occurred
      
      

   .. method:: proc match(text: exprType, ref captures ...?k): regexMatch

      
      Check for a match to this regular expression at the start of the passed
      text. If a capture group was not matched, the corresponding argument will
      get the default value for its type.
      
      For example, this function can be used to check to see if a string
      fits a particular template:
      
      .. code-block:: chapel
      
        if myRegex.match("some string") {
          doSomethingIfMatched();
        }
      
      :arg text: a string or bytes to search
      :arg captures: what to capture from the regular expression.
                     If the class:`regex` was based on string, then, these
                     should be strings or types that strings can cast to. Same
                     applies for bytes.
      :returns: an :record:`regexMatch` object representing the offset in text
                where a match occurred
      

   .. method:: proc fullMatch(text: exprType, ref captures ...?k): regexMatch

      
      Check for a match to this regular expression in the full passed text.
      If a capture group was not matched, the corresponding argument will
      get the default value for its type.
      
      :arg text: a string or bytes to search
      :arg captures: what to capture from the regular expression.
                     If the class:`regex` was based on string, then, these
                     should be strings or types that strings can cast to. Same
                     applies for bytes.
      :returns: an :record:`regexMatch` object representing the offset in text
                where a match occurred
      

   .. itermethod:: iter split(text: exprType, maxsplit: int = 0)

      
      Split the text by occurrences of this regular expression.
      If capturing parentheses are used in pattern, then the text of all
      groups in the pattern are also returned as part of the resulting array.
      If *maxsplit* is nonzero, at most maxsplit splits occur, and the
      remaining text is returned as the last element.
      
      :arg text: a string or bytes to split
      :arg maxsplit: if nonzero, the maximum number of splits to do
      :yields: each split portion, one at a time
      

   .. itermethod:: iter matches(text: exprType, param numCaptures = 0, maxMatches: int = max(int))

      Yields matches and capture groups in the text, continuing until the end of
      the text or ``maxMatches`` is reached.
      
      :arg text: the string or bytes to search
      :arg captures: (compile-time constant) the size of the captures to return
      :arg maxmatches: the maximum number of matches to return
      :yields: tuples of :record:`regexMatch` objects, the 1st is always
               the match for the whole pattern and the rest are the capture groups.
      

.. function:: operator :(x: regex(?exprType), type t: exprType)

   Returns the pattern of the :type:`regex`. 

.. method:: proc string.find(pattern: regex(string)): byteIndex

   Search the receiving string for the result of a compiled regular
   expression. Search for matches at any offset.
   
   :arg pattern: the compiled regular expression to search for
   :returns: a byteIndex representing the offset in the receiving string
             where a match occurred
   

.. method:: proc bytes.find(pattern: regex(bytes)): byteIndex

   Search the receiving bytes for the result of a compiled regular
   expression. Search for matches at any offset.
   
   :arg pattern: the compiled regular expression to search for

             where a match occurred
   

.. method:: proc string.replace(pattern: regex(string), replacement: string, count = -1): string

   Search the receiving string for the pattern. Returns a new string where the
   match(es) to the pattern is replaced with a replacement.
   
   :arg pattern: the compiled regular expression to search for
   :arg replacement: string to replace with
   :arg count: number of maximum replacements to make, values less than zero

.. method:: proc fileReader.readThrough(separator: regex(?t), maxSize = -1, stripSeparator = false): t throws where t == string || t == bytes

   
   Read until a match with the given separator is found, returning the contents of
   the ``fileReader`` through that point.
   
   If a match is found, the ``fileReader`` position is left immediately
   after it. If the separator could not be found in the next ``maxSize``
   codepoints/bytes, a ``BadFormatError`` is thrown and the ``fileReader``'s
   position is not changed. If EOF is reached before finding the separator, the
   remainder of the ``fileReader``'s contents are returned and the position is
   left at EOF.
   
   :arg separator: The :type:`~Regex.regex` separator to match with.
   :arg maxSize: The maximum number of codepoints/bytes to read. For the default
     value of ``-1``, this method can read until EOF.
   :arg stripSeparator: Whether to strip the separator from the returned
     ``string`` or ``bytes``.  If ``true``, the returned value will not
     include the captured separator.
   :returns: A ``string`` or ``bytes`` with the contents of the ``fileReader``
     up to (and possibly including) the match.
   
   :throws EofError: Thrown if nothing could be read because the ``fileReader``
     was already at EOF.
   :throws BadFormatError: Thrown if the separator was not found in the next ``maxSize``
     bytes. The ``fileReader`` position is not moved.
   :throws SystemError: Thrown if data could not be read from the ``fileReader``.

.. method:: proc fileReader.readThrough(separator: regex(string), ref s: string, maxSize = -1, stripSeparator = false): bool throws

   
   Read until a match with the given separator is found, returning the contents of
   the ``fileReader`` through that point.
   
   See the above :proc:`overload <fileReader.readThrough>` of this method for
   more details.
   
   :arg separator: The :type:`~Regex.regex` separator to match with.
   :arg s: The :type:`~String.string` to read into. Contents will be overwritten.
   :arg maxSize: The maximum number of codepoints to read. For the default value
     of ``-1``, this method can read until EOF.
   :arg stripSeparator: Whether to strip the separator from the returned
     ``string``.  If ``true``, the captured separator will be removed from ``s``.
   :returns: ``true`` if something was read, and ``false`` otherwise (i.e., the
     ``fileReader`` was already at EOF).
   
   :throws BadFormatError: Thrown if the separator was not found in the next ``maxSize``
     bytes. The ``fileReader`` position is not moved.

.. method:: proc fileReader.readTo(separator: regex(?t), maxSize = -1): t throws where t == string || t == bytes

   
   Read until a match with the given separator is found, returning the
   contents of the ``fileReader`` up to that point.
   
   If a match is found, the ``fileReader`` position is left immediately
   before it. If the separator could not be found in the next ``maxSize``
   codepoints/bytes, a ``BadFormatError`` is thrown and the ``fileReader``'s
   position is not changed. If EOF is reached before finding the separator,
