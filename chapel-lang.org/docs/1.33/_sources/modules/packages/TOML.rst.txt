Support for parsing and writing TOML files.

Chapel's Library for `Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language (TOML)
<https://github.com/toml-lang/toml>`_.

  .. note::

    The planned features and known limitations of this module can be found in
    `Improve Toml issue <https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/issues/7104>`_.



.. function:: proc parseToml(input: file): shared Toml

   Receives a TOML file as a parameter and outputs a Toml object.
   
   
   .. code-block:: chapel
   
        use TOML;
   
        const tomlFile = open("example.toml", ioMode.r);
        const toml = parseToml(tomlFile);
   
   To read tables of a TOML file, use the same syntax as accessing associative arrays. For example,
   to access to the following TOML file's project name,
   
   .. code-block:: yaml
   
        [root]
        author = "Sam Partee"
        name = "example"
        version = "1.0.0"
   
   Use the following code in chapel.
   
   .. code-block:: chapel
   
        use TOML;
   
        const tomlFile = open("example.toml", ioMode.r);
        const toml = parseToml(tomlFile);
        const projectName = ["root"]["name"] // returns a TOML object
        writeln(projectName.toString());     // to turn TOML object into string representation
   
   
   .. note::
   
     As of Chapel 1.26.0, TOML objects will print their values in the following manner:
     If the object contains a `root` table, it will be printed first.
     Keys within the root table will be printed in sorted order.
     All other tables will be printed in a sorted order after `root`, if it exists.
     All table keys will be printed in a sorted order. Prior to this change, the `root`
     table would print first, followed by keys and other tables in what may have been
     a non-deterministic manner.
   

.. function:: proc parseToml(input: fileReader): shared Toml

   Receives a channel to a TOML file as a parameter and outputs a Toml object.

.. function:: proc parseToml(input: string): shared Toml

   Receives a string of TOML format as a parameter and outputs a Toml object 

.. class:: TomlError : Error

   .. attribute:: var msg: string

   .. method:: proc init(msg: string)

   .. method:: override proc message()
