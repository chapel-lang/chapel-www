   The Debugger module is unstable due to its experimental behavior

Provides a collection of useful debugging utilities.

The Debugger module currently only provides a single function,
:proc:`breakpoint`. This function can be used to set a breakpoint in the code
that will be hit when the program is run under a debugger.

.. function:: proc breakpoint

   
   Sets a breakpoint at this point in execution if compiled with `-g`.
   
   .. warning::
      If code uses :proc:`breakpoint` and is compiled with `-g`,
      the program will not be runnable outside of a debugger
