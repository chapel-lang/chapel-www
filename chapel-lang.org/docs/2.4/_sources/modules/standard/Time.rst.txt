Time
====
**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use Time;


or

.. code-block:: chapel

   import Time;

Support for routines related to measuring the passing of time.

This module provides support for querying local wall time or UTC time,
and structures for manipulating dates and times. Note that timezone-naive
local and UTC time querying methods will produce different results if the
local time is not UTC, including potentially different calendar dates.

It also implements a record :record:`~stopwatch` that can measure the
execution time of sections of a program. The stopwatch has the potential for
microsecond resolution and is intended to be useful for performance testing.

.. record:: stopwatch

   
   Implements basic stopwatch behavior with a potential resolution of
   microseconds if supported by the runtime platform.

   A :record:`!stopwatch` is either running or stopped.

      otherwise it remains in the stopped state.
      

   .. method:: proc ref start(): void

      Returns the cumulative elapsed time, in seconds, between
      all pairs of calls to :proc:`start` and :proc:`stop`
      since the timer was created or the last call to :proc:`clear`.
      If the timer is running, the elapsed time since the last call to
      :proc:`start` is added to the return value.
      
      :returns: The elapsed time in seconds
      :rtype:   `real(64)`
