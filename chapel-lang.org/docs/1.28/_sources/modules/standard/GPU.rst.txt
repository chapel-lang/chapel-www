GPU
===
**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use GPU;


or

.. code-block:: chapel

   import GPU;

Supports utility functions for operating with GPUs.

.. warning::

  This module is unstable and its interface is subject to change in the
  future.

  GPU support is a relatively new feature to Chapel and is under active
  development.

  For the most up-to-date information about GPU support see the
  :ref:`technical note <readme-gpu>` about it.

.. function:: proc gpuWrite(const args ...?k)

   
   This function is intended to be called from within a GPU kernel and is
   useful for debugging purposes.
   
   Currently using :proc:`~ChapelIO.write` to send output to ``stdout`` will
   make a loop ineligible for GPU execution; use :proc:`gpuWrite` instead.
   
   Currently this function will only work if values of type ``c_string`` are
   passed.
   
   On NVIDIA GPUs the written values will be flushed to the terminal after
   the kernel has finished executing.  Note that there is a 1MB limit on the
   size of this buffer.
   

.. function:: proc gpuWriteln(const args ...?k)

   
   Pass arguments to :proc:`gpuWrite` and follow with a newline.
   

.. function:: proc assertOnGpu()

   
   Will halt execution at runtime if called from outside a GPU.  If used on
   first line in ``foreach`` or ``forall`` loop will also do a compile time
   check that the loop is eligible for execution on a GPU.
