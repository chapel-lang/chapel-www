OwnedObject
===========
**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use OwnedObject;



:record:`Owned` (along with :record:`~SharedObject.Shared`) manage the deallocation
of a class instance. :record:`Owned` is meant to be used when only
one reference to an object needs to manage that object's storage.

To use :record:`Owned`, allocate a class instance following this
pattern:

.. code-block:: chapel

  var myOwnedObject = new Owned(new MyClass(...));

When myOwnedObject goes out of scope, the class instance
it refers to will be deleted.

It is an error to copy initialize from myOwnedObject or to assign
it to another :record:`Owned`.

.. note::

  The ways in which :record:`Owned` may be used are currently limited.
  Copy-initialization, assignment, and `in` intent are expected to work.
  However, it is an error to use a :record:`Owned` in a way that causes the
  compiler to add an implicitly copy, such as by returning a :record:`Owned`
  that was passed by reference.

.. note::

  :record:`Owned` arguments with `const in` intent do not work yet.



.. record:: Owned

   
   :record:`Owned` manages the deletion of a class instance assuming
   that this :record:`Owned` is the only thing responsible for managing
   the lifetime of the class instance.
   


   .. method:: proc forwarding_expr1_p()

   .. method:: proc Owned(type t)

      
      Default-initialize a :record:`Owned`.
      

   .. method:: proc Owned(p, type t = p.type )

      
      Initialize a :record:`Owned` with a class instance.
      When this :record:`Owned` goes out of scope, it will
      delete whatever class instance it is storing.
      
      It is an error to directly delete the class instance
      while it is managed by a :record:`Owned`.
      
      :arg p: the class instance to manage. Must be of class type.
      

   .. method:: proc Owned(ref src: Owned, type t = src.t)

      
      Copy-initializer. Creates a new :record:`Owned`
      that takes over ownership from `src`. `src` will
      refer to `nil` after this call.
      

   .. method:: proc Owned.~Owned()

      
      The deinitializer for :record:`Owned` will destroy the class
      instance it manages when the :record:`Owned` goes out of scope.
      

   .. method:: proc ref clear()

      
      Empty this :record:`Owned` so that it stores `nil`.
      Deletes the previously managed object, if any.
      

   .. method:: proc ref retain(newPtr: p.type )

      
      Change the instance managed by this class to `newPtr`.
      If this record was already managing a non-nil instance,
      that instance will be deleted.
      

   .. method:: proc ref release(): p.type 

      
      Empty this :record:`Owned` so that it manages `nil`.
      Returns the instance previously managed by this :record:`Owned`.
      

   .. method:: proc borrow()

      
      Return the object managed by this :record:`Owned` without
      impacting its lifetime at all. It is an error to use the
      value returned by this function after the :record:`Owned`
      goes out of scope.
