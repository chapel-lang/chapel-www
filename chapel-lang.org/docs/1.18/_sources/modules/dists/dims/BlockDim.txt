BlockDim
========
**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use BlockDim;

.. class:: BlockDim

   
   This Block dimension specifier is for use with the
   :class:`DimensionalDist2D` distribution.
   
   It specifies the mapping of indices in its dimension
   that would be produced by a 1D :class:`~BlockDist.Block` distribution.
   
   **Initializer Arguments**
   
   The following ``BlockDim`` class initializers are available:
   
     .. code-block:: chapel
   
       proc BlockDim.init(
         numLocales,
         boundingBoxLow,
         boundingBoxHigh,
         type idxType = boundingBoxLow.type)
   
       proc BlockDim.init(
         numLocales: int,
         boundingBox: range(?),
         type idxType = boundingBox.idxType)
   
   The ``numLocales`` argument specifies the number of locales
   that this dimension's bounding box is to be distributed over.
   
   The ``boundingBoxLow`` and ``boundingBoxHigh`` arguments are
   a convenient replacement for the ``boundingBox`` argument,
   which specifies the bounding box in this dimension.
   
   The ``idxType``, whether provided or inferred, must match
   the index type of the domains "dmapped" using the corresponding
   ``DimensionalDist2D`` distribution.
