.. module:: CommDiagnostics
   :synopsis: This module provides support for reporting and counting

Module: CommDiagnostics
=======================

This module provides support for reporting and counting
communication operations between network-connected locales.  The
operations include various kinds of remote reads (GETs), remote
writes (PUTs), and remote forks (which are actually more like remote
procedure calls, and are used to implement ``on`` statements).
Callers can request on-the-fly output each time a remote operation
occurs, or count such operations as they occur and retrieve the
counts later.  The former gives more detailed information but has
much more overhead.  The latter has much less overhead but only
provides aggregate information.

**On-the-fly Reporting**

All forms of communication reporting and counting are done between
pairs of function calls that turn it on and off.  On-the-fly
reporting across all locales is done like this::

  startVerboseComm();
  // between start/stop calls, report comm ops initiated on any locale
  stopVerboseComm();

On-the-fly reporting for just the calling locale is similar.  Only
the procedure names change::

  startVerboseCommHere();
  // between start/stop calls, report comm ops initiated on this locale
  stopVerboseCommHere();

In either case, the output produced consists of a line written to
``stdout`` for each communication operation.  (Here ``stdout`` means
the file associated with the process, not the Chapel channel with the
same name.)

Consider this little example program::

  use CommDiagnostics;
  proc main() {
    startVerboseComm();
    var x: int = 1;
    on Locales(1) {     // should fork a blocking task onto locale 1
      x = x + 1;        // should invoke a remote put and a remote get
    }
    stopVerboseComm();
  }

Executing this on two locales with the ``-nl 2`` command line
option results in the following output::

  0: remote task created on 1
  1: t.chpl:6: remote get from 0
  1: t.chpl:6: remote put to 0

The initial number refers to the locale reporting the communication
event.  The file name and line number point to the place in the
code that triggered the communication event.  (For remote forks,
file name and line number information is not yet reported.)

**Counting Communication Operations**

Counting communication operations requires a few more calls then just
reporting them does.  In particular, the counts have to be retrieved
after they are collected and, if they have been used previously, the
internal counters have to be reset before counting is turned on.
Counting across all locales is done like this::

  // (optional) if we counted previously, reset the counters to zero
  resetCommDiagnostics();
  startCommDiagnostics();
  // between start/stop calls, count comm ops initiated on any locale
  stopCommDiagnostics();
  // retrieve the counts and report the results
  writeln(getCommDiagnostics());

Counting on just the calling locale is similar.  Just as for
on-the-fly reporting, only the procedure names change::

  // (optional) if we counted previously, reset the counters to zero
  resetCommDiagnosticsHere();
  startCommDiagnosticsHere();
  // between start/stop calls, count comm ops initiated on this locale
  stopCommDiagnosticsHere();
  // retrieve the counts and report the results
  writeln(getCommDiagnosticsHere());

The optional call to reset the counters is only needed when a program
collects counts more than once.  In this case, the counters have to
be set back to zero before starting the second and succeeding
counting periods.  By far the most common situation is that programs
only collect communication counts once per run, in which case this
step is not needed.

Note that the same internal mechanisms and counters are used for
counting on all locales and counting on just the calling locale, so
trying to do both at once may lead to surprising turn-on/turn-off
behavior and/or incorrect results.

Consider this little example program::

  use CommDiagnostics;
  proc main() {
    startCommDiagnostics();
    var x: int = 1;
    on Locales(1) {     // should fork a blocking task onto locale 1
      x = x + 1;        // should invoke a remote put and a remote get
    }
    stopCommDiagnostics();
    writeln(getCommDiagnostics());
  }

Executing this on two locales with the ``-nl 2`` command line
option results in the following output::

  (get = 0, get_nb = 0, put = 0, put_nb = 0, test_nb = 0, wait_nb = 0, try_nb = 0, fork = 1, fork_fast = 0, fork_nb = 0) (get = 1, get_nb = 0, put = 1, put_nb = 0, test_nb = 0, wait_nb = 0, try_nb = 0, fork = 0, fork_fast = 0, fork_nb = 0)

The first parenthesized group contains the counts for locale 0, and
the second contains the counts for locale 1.  So, for the
instrumented section of this program we can say that a remote fork
was executed on locale 0, and a remote get and a remote put were
executed on locale 1.


.. record:: chpl_commDiagnostics

   Aggregated communication operation counts.  This record type is
   defined in the same way by both the underlying comm layer(s) and
   this module, because we don't have a good way to inherit types back
   and forth between the two.  This first definition duplicates the
   one in the comm layer(s).
