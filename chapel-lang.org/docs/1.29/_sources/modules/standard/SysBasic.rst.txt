SysBasic
========
**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use SysBasic;


or

.. code-block:: chapel

   import SysBasic;

Types for low-level system error integration.

This module defines some system error types.

A note about the error code documentation in this file. Error descriptions
for system errors are included here for convenience only. Other
documentation, such as system man pages or the POSIX specification are the
authority on system error codes.


.. warning::

   The SysBasic module has been deprecated; most symbols have been moved to IO or OS as appropriate

.. type:: type qio_err_t = c_int

   An integral error code. This is really just a `c_int`, but code is
   clearer if you use qio_err_t to indicate arguments, variables, and return types
   that are system error codes.
   

   .. warning::

      'qio_err_t' has been deprecated; please use a 'CTypes.c_int' instead.

.. type:: type fd_t = c_int

   A system file descriptor. This is really just a `c_int`, but code is
   clearer if you use fd_t to indicate arguments, variables, and return types
   that are system file descriptors.
   

.. function:: proc ENOERR

   The error code indicating that no error occurred (Chapel specific) 

.. function:: proc EEOF

   An error code indicating the end of file has been reached (Chapel specific)
    

   .. warning::

      'SysBasic.EEOF' has been deprecated

.. function:: proc ESHORT

   An error code indicating that the end of file or the end of the
   input was reached before the requested amount of data could be read.
   (Chapel specific)
   

   .. warning::

      'SysBasic.ESHORT' has been deprecated

.. function:: proc EFORMAT

   An error code indicating a format error; for example when reading a quoted
   string literal, this would be returned if we never encountered the
   opening quote. (Chapel specific)
   

   .. warning::

      'SysBasic.EFORMAT' has been deprecated
