Chapel's Deprecation Policy
===========================

When removing a feature in Chapel, the feature is to be deprecated and
supported for at least 1 release cycle.

Major feature removals can be supported for more than 1 release cycle.

Non-public interface features can be removed or modified without deprecation.

This is the deprecation process:

1. Provide a warning or error message when a deprecated feature is used. This
   may be in the module code, compiler, or runtime, and can be emitted at
   compile-time or runtime.

The deprecation message uses the following format:

``foo is deprecated - please use bar``

For compile-time messaging you can use ``compilerWarning()`` to do this, but
when deprecating symbols the ``deprecated`` keyword often works better because
it can be applied to any symbol in a uniform way.  Look in the test/deprecated
and test/deprecated-keyword directories for many examples.  Note that the
``deprecated`` keyword itself is likely to be replaced by different syntax in
the future, though this may not affect its use in practice since deprecations
typically only last for one release anyway.

Currently, the ``deprecated`` keyword optionally takes a string literal, which
is used for the deprecated symbol's documentation and compiler warning message.
If there is also a documentation comment applied to the symbol that comment
will take precedence when producing documentation.  When we produce a compiler
warning we filter it to remove any inline markup.

This means if your deprecation message points to the preferred feature using
syntax like this: ``foo is deprecated - please use :proc:`bar```, then in the
generated documentation "bar" will link to the documentation for the "bar"
procedure, and when producing the compiler warning the ":proc:" syntax and
backticks will be filtered out.

2. Update the deprecated feature documentation to state that it is deprecated
   and point to the preferred feature.

For example:

.. code-block:: rst

    Foo module short description.

    .. warning::

        This module has been deprecated - please use :mod:`bar` instead.

    Foo module long description.

.. note::

   This step is not necessary when using the ``deprecated`` keyword to
   generate the documentation.

3. Search for error messages that refer to the deprecated feature.
   If appropriate, update them to refer to the new feature.

4. Add a deprecation test to ``test/deprecated/`` to:

  - confirm the deprecation warning works as intended
  - remind us to to remove the deprecated feature in the following release

Optionally include deprecation timeline in comments of deprecation test:

.. code-block:: chapel

    // Deprecated in Chapel 1.14, to be removed in Chapel 1.15
