This module provides low-level communication procedures.

  .. warning::

   These procedures will perform very rudimentary error checking with checks
   enabled. Namely, only locale IDs and data sizes are checked to make sure
   they have reasonable values.  Validity of the addresses is not confirmed
   under any circumstance.


.. function:: proc get(dest: c_void_ptr, src: c_void_ptr, srcLocID: int, numBytes: integral)

   
   Copy potentially remote data into local memory.
   
   :arg dest: Address in local memory where the data will be copied into
   :arg src: Address of the source in potentially remote memory
   :arg srcLocID: ID of the source locale
   :arg numBytes: Number of bytes to copy
   

.. function:: proc put(dest: c_void_ptr, src: c_void_ptr, destLocID: int, numBytes: integral)

   
   Copy local data into potentially remote memory.
   
   :arg dest: Address in potentially remote memory where the data will be copied
              into
   :arg src: Address of the source in local memory
   :arg destLocID: ID of the destination locale
   :arg numBytes: Number of bytes to copy
