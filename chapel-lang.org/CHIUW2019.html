          PGAS (Partitioned Global Address Space) programming models
          were originally designed to facilitate productive parallel
          programming at both the intra-node and inter-node levels in
          homogeneous parallel machines. However, there is a growing
          need to support accelerators, especially GPU accelerators,
          in heterogeneous nodes in a cluster. Among high-level PGAS
          programming languages, Chapel is well suited for this task
          due to its use of locales and domains to help abstract away
          low-level details of data and compute mappings for different
          compute nodes, as well as for different processing units
          (CPU vs. GPU) within a node. In this paper, we address some
          of the key limitations of past approaches on mapping Chapel
          on to GPUs as follows. First, we introduce a Chapel module,
          GPUIterator, which is a portable programming interface that
          supports GPU execution of a Chapel forall loop. This module
          makes it possible for Chapel programmers to easily use
          hand-tuned native GPU programs/libraries, which is an
          important requirement in practice since there is still a big
          performance gap between compiler-generated GPU code and
          hand-turned GPU code; hand-optimization of CPU-GPU data
          transfers is also an important contributor to this
          performance gap. Second, though Chapel programs are
          regularly executed on multi-node clusters, past work on GPU
          enablement of Chapel programs mainly focused on single-node
          execution. In contrast, our work supports execution across
          multiple CPU+GPU nodes by accepting Chapel's distributed
          domains. Third, our approach supports hybrid execution of a
          Chapel parallel (forall) loop across both a GPU and CPU
          cores, which is beneficial for specific platforms. Our
          preliminary performance evaluations show that the use of the
          GPUIterator is a promising approach for Chapel programmers
          to easily utilize a single or multiple CPU+GPU node(s) while
          maintaining portability.

          Stencil operations represent a fundamental class of
          algorithms in high-performance computing. We are interested
          in what level of performance can be expected from a
          high-productivity language such as Chapel. To this effect we
          discuss four different implementations of a generic stencil
          operation with a convergence check after each iteration. We
          start with a sequential implementation followed by a
          global-view implementation that we experiment with both on a
          16-core multi-core system as well as on a cluster with up to
          16 such nodes using domain maps. We finish with a local-view
          implementation that explicitly encodes all design decisions
          with respect to parallel execution. This paper is set up as
          a two stage experience report: We mainly report our findings
          from the users' perspective without any feedback from the
          Chapel implementers. We then report additional analysis
          performed under guidance of the Chapel team. Our
          experimental findings show that Chapel performs as expected
          on a single node. However, it does not achieve the expected
          levels of performance on our multi-node system, neither with
          the data-parallel global-view approach, nor with the
          task-parallel local-view code. We discuss the root causes of
          our reduced performance in detail and report possible
          solutions.

          Application developers are confronted with three axes of
          increasing complexity going forward; increasing
          heterogeneity in computing platforms at all levels,
          increasing heterogeneity in solvers and data management, and
          moving existing code bases to future programming
          models. While the first two will dictate which future
          programming models may deliver the needed performance, the
          third will determine their adoption. However, it is clear
          that the infrastructure backbone of large scale Multiphysics
          software has to orchestrate data and task movement between
          devices. The lifecycle of scientific software is several
          times that of platforms, therefore, any orchestration
          mechanism must have flexibility and configurability to
          remain usable on future platforms. In this presentation I
          will outline a model of an orchestration framework and the
          demands that it will place on programming models and
          languages.

          Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the prerequisite for all
          data science. EDA is non-negotiably interactive—by far the
          most popular environment for EDA is a Jupyter notebook—and,
          as datasets grow, increasingly computationally
          intensive. Several existing projects attempt to combine
          interactivity and distributed computation using programming
          paradigms and tools from cloud computing, but none of these
          projects have come close to meeting our needs for
          high-performance EDA. To fill this gap, we have developed a
          prototype, called arkouda, that allows a user to
          interactively issue massively parallel computations on
          distributed data. We designed the API of arkouda to closely
          mimic NumPy, the underlying computational library used in
          approximately 80% of EDA workflows (based on a sample of
          Jupyter notebooks). Our vision is that users will import
          arkouda as a Python module in place of NumPy (e.g. “import
          arkouda as np”) and use familiar NumPy functions and syntax
          to interact with arrays of data residing on an HPC. The
          computational heart of arkouda is a Chapel interpreter that
          accepts a pre-defined set of commands from the Python
          frontend and uses Chapel’s built-in machinery for
          multi-locale and multithreaded execution. While arkouda, in
          our experience, comes closer than anything else to enabling
          high-performance EDA, the process of developing arkouda has
          also helped identify ways Chapel must improve in order to
          become a truly productive language for data science.

          (CAL), and introduce the more general Chapel Graph Library
          (CGL). CGL is being designed to enable global-view
          programming, such that locality is abstracted from the
          user. CGL is also being designed in a way that is similar to
          Chapel's multiresolution design philosophy, where graphs are
          implemented in terms of hyper graphs, and where both the
          underlying hypergraph and overlying graphs are available for
          use. Some of the kinds of graphs being designed are
          bipartite graphs, directed and undirected graphs, and even
          trees.

          Cray HPO is a module of the data science workflow framework
          known as CrayAI. This module was released on Urika XC 1.2
          and Urika CS 1.1, making Cray HPO the first Cray product
          built with Chapel. This talk will cover the importance, the
          technical aspects, and the broader vision for Cray HPO
          including Chapel’s role in the project.
