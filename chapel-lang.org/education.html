<h2>Chapel Educator Resources</h2>

<div class="indent">

     <p>Parallel programming is becoming an increasingly crucial skill
     due to the dominance of multicore processors and the resulting
     need for familiarity with parallelism in mainstream computing.
     As a result, we expect that Computer Science courses will
     increasingly want to cover such diverse topics as:</p>

     <ul>
        <li> data parallelism
        <li> task parallelism
        <li> concurrent programming
        <li> synchronization
        <li> deadlock, livelock, and other pitfalls
        <li> locality/affinity
        <li> shared- and distributed-memory programming
        <li> scalability and performance
        <li> ...
     </ul>

     <p>The Chapel group believes that most parallel programming
     models that are in practical use today are insufficient for
     teaching <i>all</i> of these topics; moreover, most of them are
     not very good at teaching many of these concepts clearly at
     all.</p>

     <p><b>Until now:</b> We believe that Chapel has the potential to
     play an important role in parallel programming education due to
     its elegance and integrated support for diverse styles of
     parallelism.  Moreover, Chapel's open source implementation makes
     it well-suited for more advanced project-based courses in which
     students take on longer-term research or programming
     projects.</p>

<h3>Use of Chapel in Courses</h3>

<div class="indent">

     <p>The following is a list of educators and courses in which
       they've used Chapel, provided as a resource for others who are
       thinking of using Chapel in their teaching.  If you've used
       Chapel in your courses and would like to propose adding them to
       this list, please let us know at

             Chapel in upper-level computer science courses.  I've
             used Chapel as an example of a High-Performance computing
             language in our programming languages class and also as
             the language of choice in our analysis of algorithms
             class (the course is designed to teach sequential and
             parallel algorithms already).  Chapel works great in both
             classes!

                   conventional parallel programming technologies
                   (Pthreads, OpenMP, MPI), to illustrate parallel
                   programming principles and idioms in a more
                   idealized vs. more practically deployed setting.
                   For certain assignments, I gave students the option
                   of choosing between Chapel and the more
                   conventional assignment.</i>

positive. I think the high-level approach of Chapel has the potential
for a leadership in HPC education much like Pascal had, and Java still
has, for general-purpose computing.</i>
