<b>Abstract:</b>

Since APL, reductions and scans have been recognized as powerful
programming concepts.  Abstracting an accumulation loop (reduction)
and an update loop (scan), the concepts have efficient parallel
implementations based on the parallel prefix algorithm.  They are
often included in high-level languages with a built-in set of
operators such as sum, product, min, etc.  MPI provides library
routines for reductions that account for nearly nine percent of all
MPI calls in the NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB) version 3.2.  Some
researchers have even advocated reductions and scans as the principal
tool for parallel algorithm design.

<p>Also since APL, the idea of applying the reduction control
structure to a user-defined operator has been proposed, and several
implementations (some parallel) have been reported.  This paper
presents the first <i>global-view</i> formulation of user-defined
scans and an improved global-view formulation of user-defined
reductions, demonstrating them in the context of the Chapel
programming language.  Further, these formulations are extended to a
message passing context (MPI), thus transferring global-view
abstractions to <i>local-view</i> languages and perhaps signaling a
way to enhance local-view languages incrementally.  Finally, examples
are presented showing global-view user-defined reductions "cleaning
up" and/or "speeding up" portions of two NAS benchmarks, IS and MG.
In consequence, these generalized reduction and scan abstractions make
the full power of the parallel prefix technique available to both
global- and local-view parallel programming.
