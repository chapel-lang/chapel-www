<b>Abstract:</b>

The strong focus of recent High End Computing efforts
on performance has resulted in a low-level parallel programming
paradigm characterized by explicit control over
message-passing in the framework of a fragmented programming
model. In such a model, object code performance
is achieved at the expense of productivity, conciseness, and
clarity.

<p>This paper describes the design of Chapel, the Cascade
High Productivity Language, which is being developed
in the DARPA-funded HPCS project Cascade led by
Cray Inc. Chapel pushes the state-of-the-art in languages
for HEC system programming by focusing on productivity,
in particular by combining the goal of highest possible
object code performance with that of programmability
offered by a high-level user interface. The design of
Chapel is guided by four key areas of language technology:
multithreading, locality-awareness, object-orientation, and
generic programming. The Cascade architecture, which is
being developed in parallel with the language, provides key
architectural support for its efficient implementation.
