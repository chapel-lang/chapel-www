      <dd><p><i>This keynote talk argues that parallel computing,
        particularly at scale, is deserving of new programming
        languages such as the one we're building, Chapel.  It also
        notes that even if you are a traditional programmer who
        doesn't care about scalable computing, the concerns of your
        world will likely increasingly resemble those of HPC in the
        coming years.  In the end, it's your call which is more
        audacious: Chapel, or the fact that we don't already have such
        a language.</i></p>
        <p><i>For context, the UK ACCU conference at which this
      keynote was given had a "rock" theme, which led to the idea of
      using song lyric trivia to introduce each section of the talk.
      During the talk, the lyrics slides were animated such that the
      artist and album weren't revealed until guesses had been made.
