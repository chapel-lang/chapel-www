<h2>What is Chapel?</h2>

<p>Chapel is a programming language designed for productive parallel
computing on large-scale systems.  Chapel's design and implementation
have been undertaken with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to
run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the
cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was
designed.  Chapel's design and development were kicked off at Cray
Inc. in collaboration with contributors from academia, computing
centers, industry, and the open-source community.  Ongoing development
is led by the Chapel team at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).

<p>Chapel is being developed in an open-source manner at <a href =
"https://github.com/chapel-lang/">GitHub</a> under the
<a href = "http://www.apache.org/licenses/">Apache v2.0 license</a>.
The implementation makes use of other third-party open-source packages
under their own <a href = "license.html">licenses</a>.  Chapel was
initiated as part of Cray's entry in the DARPA High Productivity
Computing Systems program (HPCS).  We are currently undertaking a
multi-year effort to turn that prototype into a product-grade
implementation.

<p>Chapel supports a multithreaded execution model via high-level
abstractions for data parallelism, task parallelism, concurrency, and
nested parallelism.  Chapel's <i>locale</i> type enables users to
specify and reason about the placement of data and tasks on a target
architecture in order to tune for locality and affinity.  Chapel
supports <i>global-view</i> data aggregates with user-defined
implementations, permitting operations on distributed data structures
to be expressed in a natural manner.  In contrast to many previous
higher-level parallel languages, Chapel is designed around
a <i>multiresolution</i> philosophy, permitting users to initially
write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until
they are as close to the machine as their needs require.  Chapel
supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design,
type inference, and features for generic programming.  Existing code
can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via
interoperability features.</p>

<p>Chapel was designed from first principles rather than by extending
an existing language.  It is an imperative block-structured language,
designed to be easy to learn for users of Python, C, C++, Fortran,
Java, Matlab, and the like.  While Chapel builds on concepts and
syntax from many previous languages, its parallel features are most
directly influenced by ZPL, High-Performance Fortran (HPF), and the
Cray MTA/Cray XMT extensions to C and Fortran.</p>
