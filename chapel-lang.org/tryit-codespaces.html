<h2>Try Chapel in GitHub Codespaces</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a>
make it possible to launch cloud-based development environments with a
couple of clicks. These environments come with
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> for editing,
and give the user direct access to a Linux container. Chapel's
<a href="https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel-hello-world">'hello world' template repository</a>
is configured to be used as a Codespace.</p>

<p>To launch a GitHub codespace with Chapel, you will need to be signed in to
your GitHub account. From there, on the
<a href="https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel-hello-world">'hello world' repository</a>
page, click <strong>Use this template</strong>, then <strong>Open in a
codespace</strong>. This will start up a new Docker image with Chapel installed.
</p>

<p>The editor comes equipped with the
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chpl-hpe.chapel-vscode">Chapel extension</a>,
as well as the
<a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/tools/chplcheck/chplcheck.html"><code>chplcheck</code> linter</a>
and <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/tools/chpl-language-server/chpl-language-server.html">Chapel Language Server</a>.
Some example 'hello world' programs are included to verify that Chapel
works and to help you get started. See the
<a href="https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel-hello-world#using-a-codespace">Codespace section</a>
in the repository's README file for additional instructions.
