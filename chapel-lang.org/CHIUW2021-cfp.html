<div class="indent">

<p>
CHIUW 2021 is the 8th annual <a href = "CHIUW.html">Chapel
Implementers and Users Workshop</a>, which serves as a forum where
users and developers of the Chapel programming language (<a href =
"https://chapel-lang.org">chapel-lang.org</a>) can meet to report on
work being done with Chapel, exchange ideas, and forge new
collaborations.  Anyone interested in parallel programming and Chapel
is encouraged to attend CHIUW, from long-term enthusiasts to those
simply curious to learn more.  This year's CHIUW will be online and
there will be no registration fees.

<b><big>Submissions</big></b><br>
</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>Submissions to CHIUW 2021 can be made in one of two forms:

<ol>
<li> <b>Research papers:</b> 5-8 pages, excluding references<br>
<p>
Research papers can describe novel R&amp;D being undertaken by the
authors or an update on ongoing efforts that are of interest to Chapel
community. Papers will be evaluated by the program committee using
typical standards for academic research papers, including plagiarism
(and self-plagiarism). Research papers should be prepared using the
<a href = "https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM
conference submission format</a>. We strongly recommend checking that
each line is numbered to ease and enrich the review process.

<p>
<li> <b>Talk proposals:</b> 1-4 pages, excluding references (if any)<br>
<p>
To propose a talk at CHIUW, submit an extended abstract describing
what you intend to present. CHIUW talks can preview work that is not
yet ready for publication, recap work that the speaker has already
published, and/or describe work that is not intended for
publication. Talk proposals will be evaluated by the program and
steering committees based on their expected level of interest to the
CHIUW audience. Talk proposals should be formatted reasonably where
using the same template as the research papers is an option, though
not a requirement.

</ol>

Please submit your manuscript for either form via <a href =
"https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=chiuw2021#">EasyChair</a> by
the submission deadline below.

</p>

</div>


<p>
<a id = "presenting"></a>
<b><big>Presenting Your Work</big></b>
</p>

<p>Depending on scheduling constraints, each accepted research paper
and talk proposal will get 15-25 minutes of presentation time,
followed by 5 minutes of Q&amp;A. Research papers that are not
accepted for publication at CHIUW 2021 will automatically be
considered as a talk proposal submission, as well. If accepted as
such, authors will have the option to submit a shorter version of
their work for the final version.</p>

<p>Accepted submissions will be made available through the CHIUW 2021
website. Acceptance to CHIUW 2021 does not preclude papers from being
published elsewhere, and authors can submit their work to other
venues.</p>
