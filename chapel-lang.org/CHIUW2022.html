          <font color="DarkBlue">
            Exact diagonalization is one of the oldest and most established
            numerical methods for simulation of small quantum systems.
            Exponential scaling of the computational resources is the main
            limiting factor in its applicability, and requires highly parallel
            implementations if one wants to consider slightly larger systems. In
            this talk we will discuss the implementation of a scalable and
            user-friendly exact diagonalization package where Chapel is used for
            both shared- and distributed-memory parallelism. We will talk about
            the architecture of our package and progress in its implementation,
            focusing on multi-language interoperability and usage of Singularity
            containers for deployment.

            This paper presents the recent developments to the CHApel
            Multi-Physics Simulation (CHAMPS) software developed at
            Polytechnique Montréal. This software is at its core a 2D and 3D
            flow simulation software relying on the Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged
            Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations towards application to aircraft
            aerodynamics. Other physics such as ice accretion and structural
            mechanics allow to perform aero-icing and aero-elastic simulations.
            New features added this year include methods to handle overset grids
            and to perform linear stability analyses of fluid simulations. These
            features are presented on concrete aircraft applications.

            A large outstanding problem in astrophysics is the nature of dark
            matter—the mass in the Universe which interacts gravitationally but
            does not couple to light. One compelling theory of dark matter is
            called UltraLight Dark Matter (ULDM), describing a particle with a
            mass m&nbsp;~&nbsp;10<sup>-22</sup> eV which could form so-called
            "halos" of dark matter
            around galaxies. In this talk, we will present (1) the ULDM halos we
            create and evolve with our Chapel-powered simulator chplUltra, (2)
            how we use Chapel to calculate the eigenstates of a given ULDM halo,
            and (3) one application for using these techniques to advance ULDM
            research.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
          <font color="DarkBlue">
            Fabric Attached Memory (FAM) is of increasing interest in HPC
            clusters because it enables fast access to large datasets required
            in High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA) and Exploratory Data
            Analytics (EDA). Most approaches to handling FAM force
            programmers either to use low-level APIs, which are difficult to
            program, or to rely upon abstractions from file systems or key-value
            stores, which make accessing FAM less attractive than other levels
            in the memory model due to the overhead they bring. The Chapel
            language is designed to allow HPC programmers to use high-level
            programming constructs that are easy to use, while delegating the
            task of managing data and compute partitioning across the cluster to
            the Chapel compiler and runtime. This abstract summarizes the
            approach to integrate FAM access within the Chapel language
            described in the paper.

          <font color="DarkBlue">
            We identify techniques to interface Chapel programs with parallel,
            distributed, MPI-based libraries written in C++ without storing
            multiple copies of shared data. This integration enables Chapel
            users to take advantage of the vast array of capabilities developed
            in parallel numerical libraries without the memory cost of
            duplicated data. We demonstrate two approaches to interface Chapel
            code with the MPI-based graph and numerical solver libraries Grafiki
            and Trilinos. The first uses a single Chapel executable to call a C
            function that interacts with the MPI libraries; it requires Chapel
            users to understand the Grafiki library interfaces and link their
            codes with the MPI-based libraries. The second uses the Unix mmap
            function to allow separate Chapel and Grafiki executables to read
            and write to the same block of memory on a node; it maintains
            greater independence between the Chapel and MPI-based codes,
            simplifying the Chapel user's experience. We also encapsulated the
            second approach in Docker/Singularity containers to maximize ease of
            use by Chapel users. Comparisons of the two approaches using shared
            and distributed memory installations of Chapel show that both
            approaches are feasible for sharing data between Chapel and
            MPI-based libraries, yielding similar scalability and performance
            with no penalty from using mmap.

            In this talk, we discuss our experience in accelerating a real-world
            Chapel application, namely CHAMPS (CHApel Multi-Physics Simulation),
            on GPUs with the GPUIterator and GPUAPI modules. CHAMPS is a 3D
            unstructured finite-volume Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes (RANS)
            flow solver developed at Polytechnique Montréal and is written fully
            in Chapel. We use the potential flow solver in CHAMPS.

            The results show our Chapel-GPU variants give significant speedups
            of up to 29.5x on Cori-GPU, 25.3x on Summit, and 9.1x on an AMD
            server compared to a baseline Chapel-CPU version on each platform.

            Have you ever typed "export CHPL_COMM=gasnet"? If you’ve used Chapel
            with multi-locale support on a system without "Cray" in the model
            name, then you’ve probably used GASNet. Did you ever wonder what
            GASNet is?  What GASNet should mean to you? This talk aims to answer
            those questions and more.  Chapel has system-specific
            implementations of multi-locale communication for Cray-branded
            systems including the Cray XC and HPE Cray EX lines. On other
            systems, Chapel communication uses the GASNet communication library
            embedded in third-party/gasnet. In this talk, that third-party will
            introduce itself to you in the first person.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
          <font color="DarkBlue">
            The Chapel programming language and runtime provides programmers
            with productivity advantages for developing applications with
            irregular memory access patterns. Specifically, language support for
            PGAS-style operations and implicit remote communication lessen the
            burden on the programmer to reason about remote memory accesses to
            distributed arrays. However, these productivity benefits naturally
            lead programmers to write code that causes fine-grained remote
            communication, which poses significant performance challenges on
            modern computing systems. Our prior work has demonstrated that the
            performance of these irregular codes in Chapel can be dramatically
            improved by manually applying optimizations that selectively
            replicate remotely accessed data at runtime. In this talk, we will
            discuss our current efforts on bridging the gap between performance
            and productivity for irregular applications in Chapel by automating
            the selective data replication optimization. To this end, we have
            designed and implemented a compiler optimization that automatically
            identifies candidate irregular accesses using static analysis and
            applies transformations to produce optimized code, all without
            requiring user intervention. Our results show that runtime
            performance can be improved by as much as 52x on a Cray XC system
            with a low-latency interconnect and 364x on a standard Linux cluster
            with an Infiniband interconnect.

          <font color="DarkBlue">
            This talk discusses changes made in Arkouda (a NumPy-like Python
            package with a Chapel backend server) to add support for Apache
            Parquet, which is a columnar file format designed for data science.
            The implementation uses Chapel's interoperability features to
            interact with Parquet's C++ API. Since Chapel does not have native
            support for C++ interoperability, a thin C-based wrapper library was
            constructed. To improve the performance of the implementation,
            optimizations were added to read data in batches and leverage
            Chapel's parallel programming features. The implementation is
            evaluated by comparing it against HDF5, a well-known file format for
            HPC workflows, which has native support in Arkouda. The results of
            the comparison show that, with these optimizations, Parquet can now
            outperform HDF5 when operating on datasets stored within a large
            number of files.

          <font color="DarkBlue">
            The K-Truss of a graph is a cohesive subgraph that has been widely
            used for community detection in applications such as social networks
            and security analysis. In this paper, we first propose one optimized
            triangle search kernel with a few operations that can be used in
            both triangle counting and triangle search to replace the existing
            list intersection method. Based on the optimized kernel, three truss
            analytics algorithms, an optimized K-Truss parallel algorithm, a
            maximal K-Truss parallel algorithm, and a Truss decomposition
            parallel algorithm, are developed to efficiently enable different
            kinds of graph analysis. Moreover, all proposed parallel algorithms
            have been implemented in the highly-productive parallel language
            Chapel and integrated into the open-source framework Arkouda.
            Experimental results compared with the existing list
            intersection-based method show that for both synthetic and
            real-world graphs, the proposed method can significantly improve the
            performance of truss analysis on large graphs. The implemented
            method is <a href="https://github.com/Bears-R-Us/arkouda-njit">publicly available from GitHub</a>.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
          <font color="DarkBlue">
            I describe a trajectory of using a number of programming languages
            in research, from my early days with Fortran, Pascal and Modula-2,
            to mainly C and Python during approximately 30 years, and then to
            Chapel in the last 2 years. During all of this time the desktop PC
            has been adequate to my processing needs; therefore, this is
            essentially a "Chapel at the desktop" experience report. Chapel is
            a very elegant language, providing the power and speed of C and
            Fortran, while allowing a high degree of abstraction and
            expressiveness that rivals Python's. I have used it in the last two
            years for: calculating statistics over massive turbulence datasets,
            implementing models for lake evaporation in hydrology, and testing
            some relatively simple numerical solutions of partial differential
            equations. Its easy portability from C, Fortran and Python allowed
            fast translation and re-use of my existing libraries. On the few
            (but not impossible to live with) shortcomings, passing functions as
            procedure parameters is somewhat unwieldy; re-indexing arrays in
            procedures is verbose; compilation could be faster; and executables
            are very large.
