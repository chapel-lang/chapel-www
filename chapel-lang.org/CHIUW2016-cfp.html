<b><big>Overview</big></b><br /> 
</p>
<div class="indent">

<p>CHIUW 2016&mdash;the third annual <a href = "CHIUW.html">Chapel
Implementers and Users Workshop</a>, to be held in conjunction
with <a href = "http://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2016/">IEEE IPDPS 2016</a>&mdash;will
continue our annual series of workshops designed to bring developers
and users of the Chapel language (<a href =
"https://chapel-lang.org">chapel-lang.org</a>) together to report on
work being done across the broad open-source community and to explore
ways to advance Chapel.  Attendance is open to anyone interested in
Chapel, from the most seasoned Chapel user or developer to someone
simply curious to learn more.
</p>
</div>


<p>
<b><big>Format</big></b> <br />
<div class="indent">

<p>The main day of the workshop will be presentation- and
discussion-based, as in previous years&mdash;essentially, a full-day
mini-conference focusing on Chapel.  We are also interested in holding
an additional "code camp" day on Saturday, as at <a href =
"CHIUW2015.html">CHIUW 2015</a>, to support interactive
pair-programming and collaborative activities, if interest and
scheduling permit.  <!-- The program weill be posted at <a href =
"CHIUW2016.html">chapel-lang.org/CHIUW2016.html</a> as it is
formulated.-->
</p>


<p>
<b>Mini-Conference Day:</b> The backbone of the main day of CHIUW will
be composed of talks from members of the Chapel community describing
work they are undertaking within the context of Chapel.  Other
activities during this first day will include:

<ul>
<li> A pre-workshop introduction to Chapel for those new to the language
<li> A "State of the Chapel Project" talk
<li> A keynote by Nikhil Padmanabhan (Professor of Physics, Yale University)
<li> A community discussion on Chapel's next steps and future
</ul>

<p>
Interested parties are encouraged to submit papers and talks using the
process outlined <a href = "#callForSubmissions">below</a>.  The
selection of speakers and final program will be decided upon by the
workshop's <a href = "#committee">program committee</a>.</p>

<p>For CHIUW 2016, we will be accepting paper submissions for the
first time, though we will also accept talk proposals without papers
as in past years.  We anticipate that accepted papers will be awarded
longer talk slots than proposals that are talks only.  Papers will be
included in the IEEE IPDPS workshop proceedings which will be
distributed at the conference and submitted for inclusion in the IEEE
Xplore Digital Library after the conference.  All talk slides and
materials developed for the workshop will be archived on the CHIUW
workshop website.

<b>Code Camp Day:</b></a> <strike>Pending sufficient interest</strike>
CHIUW will also include a second "code-camp" half-day for
pair-programming and collaborative activities.  This day is designed
to partner members of the core Chapel team with members of the
community who are striving to gain better knowledge of some aspect of
the Chapel code base.  If you have a specific topic or activity that
you'd like to propose for this day (e.g., "I'd like to work with
someone to try coding algorithm x in Chapel" or "I'd like someone to
help me get familiar with aspect y of the Chapel
compiler/runtime/module code base"), please submit it using the
process <a href = "#callForSubmissions">below</a>.

<b><big>Call For Submissions</big></b><br />
</p>

<div class="indent">

<b>Paper Submissions:</b> If you have Chapel-related work that you
would like to present at CHIUW and publish as part of the IEEE IPDPS
proceedings, please prepare your manuscript according to the
formatting guidelines given in the <a href =
"http://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2016/2016_call_for_papers.html">IEEE IPDPS 2016
call for papers</a> (see "What/Where to Submit").  All accepted papers
will be governed by the IEEE IPDPS dates and procedures regarding workshop
publications.</p>

Submit your manuscript via <a href =
"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chiuw2016">EasyChair</a> by
the <a href = "#dates">date</a> shown below.</p>


<b>Talk Proposals:</b> As in past instances of CHIUW, we will also
consider talk proposals that are not accompanied by a paper, though
the expectation is that they will be awarded a shorter presentation
slot.  To propose such a talk, submit a one-page extended abstract
using a reasonable format and 10- or 11-point font.  Extended
abstracts should be sure to include:

<ul>
<li> The title of the talk
<li> The list of authors and their affiliations
<li> The presenting author
<li> A detailed description of the work you intend to present
</ul>

</p>

Submit your extended abstract via <a href =
"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chiuw2016">EasyChair</a> by
the <a href = "#dates">date</a> shown below.</p>


<p>
<b>Code Camp Proposals:</b> If you have a pair-programming or
collaborative activity that you would like to participate in during a
code camp day at the workshop, please send a short paragraph
describing it to <b><?php include("email-submissions.html");?></b>.
We hope to be able to accept all reasonable proposals, the primary
constraint being the number of Chapel team members available at the
workshop to participate in them.  For this reason, from a
planning/resource perspective, the earlier we receive these proposals
the better, though we will consider additional ad-hoc activities right
up to the day itself (to support ideas that come up during the
mini-conference day, for example).
</p>

<p>
<b>Other Proposals:</b> Chapel is a community language and our
intention is for CHIUW to become an increasingly community-run event,
so if you have proposals for other activities that you would like to
see take place at CHIUW (particularly if you're interested in leading
that activity), please let us know by
mailing <b><?php include("email-submissions.html");?></b>.
