<h2>Get Involved in the Chapel Project</h2>

<p>Want to improve the programability of multi-cores, clusters, and
supercomputers?</p>

<p>Contribute to the Chapel project!</p>

 
<p>You can contribute to the Chapel project in many ways. Tasks vary
greatly in the time, level of experience, and technical capability
required.</p>


<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<h4>Read and Improve the Chapel web pages and documentation.</h4>

<p>Besides this website, there is the <a href =
"docs/language/spec.html">Chapel Specification</a>, the <a href
= "docs/">online documentation</a>, and <a href =
"https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/tree/main/doc/">several
READMEs</a> in the release itself.  Help in translating the
introductory material to other (natural) languages is appreciated!</p>


<h4>Try writing an application in Chapel.</h4>

<p>You might already be familiar with some good benchmarks that you
can use to evaluate a new language, compiler, and runtime.  Try
implementing an interesting application.  Share your experiences on
the <a href = "https://chapel.discourse.group/c/users">Chapel
Discourse Site</a>.


<h4>Get the word out about Chapel.</h4>

<p>If you like Chapel and think more people should know about the
language so that it can achieve better adoption and support, make
reviews, ratings, or other postings.  There are several Chapel project
pages that have reviews and ratings:</p>

<ul> 
  <li> <a href = "https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel">GitHub</a>
  <li> <a href = "https://www.openhub.net/p/chapel">OpenHub</a>
</ul>

You can bring up Chapel in discussion sites like <a href =
"http://www.reddit.com/r/programming">reddit</a>.  You can post about
Chapel in your own blog or other social media sites.</p>

<p>If you've had difficulties with Chapel, the team would appreciate
the chance to hear about and respond to the problems through
the <a href = "https://chapel.discourse.group/c/users">Chapel
Discourse site</a> or <?php include("email-chapel.html");?>. You can
include both the problem and the response in your social media
posting.</p>



<h4>Test Chapel on your system or on a new platform</h4>

To learn about running Chapel's test system on your machine, see <a href = "https://chapel-lang.org/docs/developer/bestPractices/TestSystem.html">this best practice document</a>.  But in brief, the steps are:
<pre>
 git clone https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel.git
 cd chapel
 source util/setchplenv.bash 
 make
 start_test test/
</pre>

If you want to make sure Chapel continues to work on your favorite
platform, you can contribute computer time to perform regular
testing. Please post on the <a href =
"https://chapel.discourse.group/">Chapel Discourse Site</a>
or <?php include("email-chapel.html");?> to discuss.



<h4>Participate in Chapel discussions</h4>

Join the <a href = "https://chapel.discourse.group/">Chapel
Discourse</a> community.  Please keep discussions friendly!


<h4>Help report, minimize, and reproduce bugs</h4>

<p>Bugs get reported to the Chapel GitHub issues page, but sometimes
the Chapel developers have trouble finding a small version of the
problematic code. You can help by testing bugs reported on issues
on your system and by trying to make the bug report as simple and
clear as possible.</p>


<h4>Garden in the test/ directory</h4>

The Chapel project has an extensive test suite in the test/ directory in
the source repository. The test system is pretty large though and needs
occasional pruning. If you can find tests that can be combined or removed
because that code is covered elsewhere, you can make testing faster for
everybody. Also, bug reports and feature requests are stored in the test
system as .future files. When somebody goes to implement the requested
feature or to fix the bug, they'll need a clear description of the
problem. Also, the .future files are supposed to begin with a summary
line that also categorize the future - see
doc/rst/developer/bestPractices/TestSystem.rst- but sometimes they aren't filed
correctly.


<h4>Propose language or library changes</h4>

<p>If you've written a few Chapel programs, you probably have already
formed opinions about areas in which the language or library could
improve. Write up a description of what you'd like to see improved and
any ideas you have for how to improve it - and send it along to
chapel-developers to start a discussion.</p>

<h3>Development Tasks</h3>

<h4>Fix bugs and add simple features</h4>

<p>Chapel has many known bugs and feature requests. These are
typically filed as .future files within the testing system. From a
clone of the GitHub repository, you can use:
<pre>
 find test . -name '*.future'
</pre>
for example, to get a listing of them. You could pick your favorite or
ask on chapel-developers if there are topical bugs that need some
attention. Also ask on chapel-developers if you're trying to fix
a particular bug or add a particular feature but aren't sure where
to find the related code.</p>


<h4>Work with external libraries</h4>

<p>You might already have experience with existing C or C++ libraries
that might be worthwhile to call from Chapel programs. Examples
include mathematical libraries, file format handling, communication,
plotting, graphics, or pretty much anything else. Try using these
libraries from Chapel programs with the external function mechanism
(see doc/rst/technotes/extern.rst) and create a Chapel module
that wraps the functionality in a more friendly way if that's
appropriate. The Chapel module might better integrate with Chapel's
I/O system or support the distribution of the objects used in the
library.


<h4>Implement new optimizations</h4>

<p>There's always room to try out new optimizations. If you have an idea for
a new optimization that might apply to Chapel programs, it's probably a
good idea to try it out first by manually changing an unoptimized Chapel
program into an optimized one - or modifying the generated C code. Once
you have a sense how much the optimization helps, it's a good time to
check on chapel-developers if others think that the optimization is
appropriate or if somebody else is already working on it. Then, go ahead
and develop it!
If you're interested in developing an optimization but don't have an idea
to start with, just ask on chapel-developers.</p>
