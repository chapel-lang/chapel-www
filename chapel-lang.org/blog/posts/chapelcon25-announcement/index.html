    <p>ChapelCon is coming, and will be back this Fall!</p>
<h4 id="when-is-chapelcon-25">
  <a href="#when-is-chapelcon-25">When is ChapelCon &lsquo;25?</a>
</h4>
<p>Historically, <a href="../chapelcon24">ChapelCon</a> (and CHIUW during its time) have always been held in the early days of summer.
It&rsquo;s been a delicate balance, dodging holidays and other conferences to make ChapelCon as accessible as possible.
But this year, that early summer period is especially jam-packed.</p>
<p>To save folks from having to choose between events, <strong>we&rsquo;ve moved ChapelCon &lsquo;25 from the summer to the fall between Tuesday, October 7th and Friday, October 10th.</strong> This gives folks plenty of time to prepare for ChapelCon after their summer breaks and is more than a month ahead of SC. This makes ChapelCon the perfect place to give the community a sneak peak of Chapel-related material and to get feedback from the community. The CFP will go public around the end of June, with submissions due at the end of July.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-expect">
  <a href="#what-to-expect">What to Expect</a>
</h4>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s ChapelCon was a <a href="../chapelcon24-retro">huge success</a>, and we&rsquo;re making some changes to ChapelCon &lsquo;25 to keep that momentum going. To start, we&rsquo;re shifting from a 3-day agenda to a 4-day agenda.
Last year, we had a day-long tutorial session, followed by a day-long Open Lab session, where participants worked on their own projects or prompts provided by the ChapelCon organizers.
Community members really loved the Coding Day sessions, and they&rsquo;ll be returning for ChapelCon &lsquo;25.
Participants suggested intertwining the Tutorial and Coding Day sessions, and we&rsquo;ve listened, expanding these activities over two days instead of just one.</p>
<p>Those two days are first, and will focus on action.
Each day, we&rsquo;ll start with short tutorials that will lead into hands-on exercises.
Then, like at ChapelCon &lsquo;24, we&rsquo;ll break into the &ldquo;Free Code&rdquo; sessions, where participants can work on their own Chapel projects or on provided project ideas to hone their Chapel skills.
The Free Code sessions will be interspersed with small, optional demo sessions showing off useful libraries, tooling, and language features.
Throughout both days, we&rsquo;ll continue the tradition of holding Office Hours, where community members can meet 1-on-1 with Chapel developers on specific problems with their applications.</p>
<p>The last two days of ChapelCon &lsquo;25 will be all about sharing the awesome things community members have been doing with Chapel.
Like last year, we&rsquo;ll have a mix of presentations and demos from the community, as well as a State of the Project update and a Keynote Address.
The presentation days will be shorter than previous years, to give folks more time to digest the content.
Presentation time slots will be more flexible, allowing both lightning talks and more in-depth contributions. More details about the submission process will come out with the call for submissions in the upcoming months.</p>
<h4 id="closing-thoughts">
  <a href="#closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</a>
</h4>
<p>ChapelCon is about supporting the community across all experience levels, and this year&rsquo;s programming is poised to do just that.
CHIUW has expanded into the dynamic event that ChapelCon is today only because of the amazing contributions of the community, from sharing their work using Chapel to helping organize the event itself.
We&rsquo;re so excited to connect with community members, new and experienced, at ChapelCon &lsquo;25, and we&rsquo;ll be back with more updates soon!</p>
