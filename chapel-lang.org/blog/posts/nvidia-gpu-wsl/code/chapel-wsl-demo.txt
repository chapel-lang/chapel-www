# This is a list of the commands used in the Chapel NVIDIA WSL demo.
# These steps assume that you have already installed the NVIDIA driver in Windows
# and have enabled WSL2 with an Ubuntu distribution. These should be run in an
# Ubuntu terminal. Except for those that are explicitly stated to be added to
# the ~/.bashrc file, these commands should not need to be run again after the
# initial setup.
