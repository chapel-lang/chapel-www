    <p>The Chapel developer community is proud to announce the release of
Chapel version 1.33!  Highlights of this release include brand new
tools, broader support for co-locales, and further steps toward
Chapel 2.0.  As always, to obtain a copy, see the <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/download.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Downloading
Chapel</a> page on the Chapel
website.</p>

  <a href="#our-next-release-candidate-for-chapel-20">Our Next Release Candidate for Chapel 2.0</a>
</h4>
<p>Continuing from where we left off in September, Chapel 1.33
constitutes our next (and potentially final?) release candidate for
Chapel 2.0.  If the Chapel 2.0 concept is new to you, be sure to
check out our <a href="../../posts/announcing-chapel-1.32/#chapel-20-release-candidate">September release announcement</a>
for an introduction.</p>
<p>For 1.33, we have updated Chapel&rsquo;s <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.33/modules/standard/IO.html#IO.binarySerializer"target="_blank" rel="noopener">binary
serializer</a>
to address user concerns about the way certain types were being
represented in version 1.32.  Specifically, that release replaced
our legacy binary IO capability with a serialization-based approach
and, in doing so, made some changes to certain types by having them
embed additional structure, like the length of a string/bytes value,
or whether or not a class variable was storing <code>nil</code>.  This
additional meta-data was unpopular with users, causing us to back
out those elements and revert to having binary serialization use an
unstructured format.  Meanwhile, for those who preferred the
additional structure, we moved that support into a new
<a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.33/modules/packages/ObjectSerialization.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lsquo;ObjectSerialization&rsquo;</a>
package that we intend to make even more sophisticated and capable
over time—e.g., capable of checkpointing and restoring complex data
structures.</p>
<p>The other major stabilization-related improvement in Chapel 1.33 is
a significant clean-up to the <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.33/modules/standard/Random.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lsquo;Random&rsquo;
module</a>,
which was considered unstable in version 1.32 due to lack of time
and recent attention.  In version 1.33, we have moved the antiquated
NPB random number generator out into <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.33/modules/packages/NPBRandom.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new package
module</a>
and streamlined other aspects of the <code>Random</code> interface, removing
the blanket unstable warning.  Additional improvements are still in
the works, and we currently expect the <code>Random</code> module to be stable
in the next release.</p>
<p>At present, Chapel 2.0 is slated to be released in March 2024,
barring surprises or an outpouring of user concerns with version
1.33.  As with version 1.32, we encourage users who are relying on
Chapel to let us know whether there are aspects of its current
definition that they feel uneasy stabilizing as-is.  For further
information on how you can help us with this effort, please refer to
Lydia Duncan&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.hpe.com/blog/help-us-prioritize-features-for-future-releases-of-chapel/"target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent call to
action</a>
on the <a href="https://developer.hpe.com/blog/"target="_blank" rel="noopener">HPE Developer blog</a>.</p>
<h4 id="new-tools">
  <a href="#new-tools">New Tools</a>
</h4>
<p>Chapel 1.33 features three new tools that users may be interested in
incorporating into their workflow.</p>
<p>The first of these was developed to support the request for user
feedback mentioned just above.  It can be used to summarize the
unstable features that a Chapel program is using in an anonymized
way.  Our hope is that this will simplify the process of having
users take stock of which unstable features they&rsquo;re using, allowing
them to either advocate for them to be stabilized sooner, or to
switch to more stable features.  For more information about how to
apply this tool to your programs, please see <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.33/tools/unstableWarningAnonymizer/unstableWarningAnonymizer.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener">its
documentation</a>.
And, as a fun fact: this tool is written in Chapel itself!</p>
<p>The next tool is <code>chplcheck</code>, a prototype linter that checks Chapel
code against a number of style rules, many of which reflect
conventions that we have been adopting within our standard modules
as part of the Chapel 2.0 stabilization process.  The various rules
can be disabled or enabled, so that you can pick a mix of them that
correlate to the style you&rsquo;ve adopted for your Chapel project.  For
convenience, <code>chplcheck</code> supports the Language Server Protocol
(LSP), permitting it to be integrated into your favorite
LSP-compatible editor.  For example, the following screenshot shows
a snippet of Chapel code within Neovim along with the <code>chplcheck</code>
messages that it generates:</p>
<figure class="fullwide"><img src="../../posts/announcing-chapel-1.33/chplcheck.png">
</figure>

<p>One of the very cool aspects of <code>chplcheck</code> is that it leverages our
standalone Dyno front-end compiler library via a new set of <a href="https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/tree/main/tools/chapel-py"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python
bindings</a>
that have been developed as a means of accessing its features.  The set of
<code>chplcheck</code> rules is also extensible, allowing developers to create
their own rules (and, ideally, contribute them back to the
community)!  For more information, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/tree/main/tools/chplcheck#readme"target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>chplcheck</code>
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The third tool can be used to find a module&rsquo;s public symbols that
are lacking documentation.  This has been useful to us in validating
our documentation for Chapel 2.0, but will also be useful to
programmers who are creating Chapel libraries or applications and
relying upon <code>chpldoc</code>-based documentation.  In Chapel 1.33, find
the tool in <code>tools/chpldoc/findUndocumentedSymbols</code>.  For
information on its use, run <code>findUndocumentedSymbols --help</code> or see
the comments at the top of
<a href="https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/blob/release/1.33/tools/chpldoc/findUndocumentedSymbols.py#L23-L71"target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>tools/chpldoc/findUndocumentedSymbols.py</code></a>.</p>
<h4 id="improved-co-locale-support-and-performance-studies">
  <a href="#improved-co-locale-support-and-performance-studies">Improved Co-locale Support and Performance Studies</a>
</h4>
<p>In the 1.32 release announcement, we described Chapel&rsquo;s recently
added support for <em>co-locales</em>, in which multiple locales can be
mapped to a single compute node in order to take advantage of
multiple NICs, or to improve NUMA behavior by giving each locale its
own socket.  In Chapel 1.33, we have extended support for this
feature to the <code>gasnetrun_*</code> and <code>slurm-gasnetrun_*</code> families of
launchers.</p>
<p>Since Chapel 1.32, we also gathered an extensive set of Chapel
performance graphs for various benchmarks running on Slingshot-11
and InfiniBand systems.  Many of these results demonstrate the
benefits of co-locales.  For example, the following pair of graphs
demonstrates the execution-time benefits that running 2 locales per
node can have for the <a href="https://github.com/ParRes/ISx"target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISx benchmark</a>
running on (single-NIC) Slingshot-11 and InfiniBand HDR-200 systems
with dual-socket AMD Milan compute nodes.</p>
<figure class="fullwide"><img src="../../posts/announcing-chapel-1.33/co-locales-ISx.png">

Chapel 1.33 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>a new
<a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.33/modules/standard/Math.html#Math.fma"target="_blank" rel="noopener">fma()</a>

</li>
</ul>
