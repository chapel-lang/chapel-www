    <p>In this edition of our <a href="../../series/7-questions-for-chapel-users/">Seven Questions for Chapel
Users</a>
series, we turn to Dr. Nelson Luís Dias from Brazil who is using
Chapel to analyze data generated by the <a href="https://www.attoproject.org/"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Tall Tower Observatory
(ATTO)</a>, a project dedicated to
long-term, 24/7 monitoring of greenhouse gas fluctuations.  Read on to
learn more about his work and use of Chapel!</p>

<p>I am Nelson Luís Dias, Department of Environmental Engineering,
Federal University of Paraná, Brazil. Professor. My computing
background is serial programming with “classical” programming
languages such as Fortran, Pascal, and C (mainly), as well as
Python. I had not done any parallel programming until Chapel.</p>

<p>In the last decades, fluxes of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, and some
others) have been measured over all types of ecosystems around the
world. These measurements are essential to understand the effect on
the climate of carbon emission and sequestering by those ecosystems,
and they involve very large amounts of data, typically wind speed
components and gas concentrations measured 10 times per second. To
further extract hourly and daily fluxes from the data requires
statistical processing of those datasets, and fast (compiled) and
easily parallelizable languages such as Chapel help to streamline the
calculation of those fluxes.</p>
<p>My research areas are Hydrology and Atmospheric Turbulence. I work
with my students and postdocs analyzing turbulence data, and more
recently (we are in our first steps) with computational fluid
dynamics. As an example of my research work using Chapel, here is an
evaporation model that I created, fully developed in Chapel: It was
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2022WR033012"target="_blank" rel="noopener">published in Water Resources
Research</a>. The model itself,
called STAEBLE, <a href="https://github.com/nldias/staeble-wrr"target="_blank" rel="noopener">is available in
GitHub</a>. I think it is a good
example of the language’s qualities, such as ease of coding and
general applicability.</p>

<p>Turbulence datasets are very large, and their statistical processing
can be quite demanding. Chapel allows me to use the available CPU and
GPU power in the computer efficiently, and reduces the time involved
in most analyses significantly. This can be done without low-level
programming of message passing, data synchronization, managing
threads, etc. (which I have not mastered). We work mainly with desktop
computers with relatively high-end CPUs and GPUs.</p>

<p>What is also very important is that Chapel is very good at simpler
tasks as well, such as scripting. I have by now mostly replaced
traditional scripting tools such as AWK and Python with small Chapel
programs. This reduces the brain RAM :-) required to cope with
different syntaxes, and streamlines my workflow.</p>

  <a href="#4-what-initially-drew-you-to-chapel">4. What initially drew you to Chapel?</a>
</h3>
<p>Two things mostly. First, I was using Python heavily, but it is too
slow for many “for loops” that are intrinsic in my line of work. This
had already sent me in the direction of alternatives such as Numba,
Codon, maybe Julia, etc.  Second, I am interested in turbulence
numerical modeling, and this means the need for a compiled, parallel
language. Chapel answers both.</p>
<h3 id="5-what-are-your-biggest-successes-that-chapel-has-helped-achieve">
  <a href="#5-what-are-your-biggest-successes-that-chapel-has-helped-achieve">5. What are your biggest successes that Chapel has helped achieve?</a>
</h3>
<p>Probably rewriting all my data processing routines in Chapel. It is
very easy to translate from C because the syntax is similar for both
languages; and almost the same goes for Python. Along the way, some
novel routines have already been written in Chapel for the first
time. I am particularly fond of my Levenberg-Marquardt implementation,
which is part of my nstat.chpl module (see <a href="https://nldias.github.io/software.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://nldias.github.io/software.html</a>). The
result is both faster coding and faster processing, overall. Most of
the processing time improvements come from straightforward use of
<code>forall</code> and <code>foreach</code> loops.</p>

  <a href="#6-if-you-could-improve-chapel-with-a-finger-snap-what-would-you-do">6. If you could improve Chapel with a finger snap, what would you do?</a>
</h3>
<p>Two things, both non-essential:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Smaller generated executables. Chapel’s executables are big. This
would help save some space on disk, and time when backing up files
to Cloud storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow generic arrays to be arguments of first-class procedures. But
Chapel allows an elegant work-around, among many possibilities. See my
solution <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/ChapelCon/2024/dias.pdf"target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>Chapel is not only very good at high-performance computing, parallel
computing, etc.  It is also very good for general-purpose
computing. As of 2.1, it is already being made available <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/blog/posts/announcing-chapel-2.1/#linux-packages"target="_blank" rel="noopener">via linux
packages</a>
(<code>.deb</code>, etc.) which is a big leap into making it accessible to a wider
audience. I plan to teach numerical methods with it this coming
semester, and can foresee it carving a place in the sun as a modern,
fast, language for science and engineering.</p>
