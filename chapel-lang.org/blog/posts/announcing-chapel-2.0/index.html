    <p>Today, the Chapel team is excited to announce the release of Chapel version 2.0.
After years of hard work and continuous improvements, Chapel shines as an
enjoyable and productive programming language for distributed and parallel
computing. People with diverse application goals are leveraging Chapel to
quickly develop fast and scalable software, including physical simulations,
massive data and graph analytics, portions of machine learning pipelines, and
more. The 2.0 release brings stability guarantees to Chapel&rsquo;s battle-tested
features, making it possible to write performant and elegant code for laptops,
GPU workstations, and supercomputers with confidence and convenience.</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/blob/main/CHANGES.md#version-20"target="_blank" rel="noopener">numerous usability and performance improvements</a> &mdash;
including many <a href="../../posts/changes-since-2.0-rc1/">over the previous release candidate</a> &mdash;
the 2.0 release of Chapel is <strong>stable</strong>: the core language and library features are
designed to be backwards-compatible from here on. As Chapel continues
to grow and evolve, additions or changes to the language should not require
adjusting any existing code.</p>
<p>Those new to Chapel might be wondering how the language came about.
Chapel was pioneered by a small team at Cray Inc. who wanted to
help anyone make full use of any parallel hardware available to them &mdash;
from their multicore laptop to a large-scale supercomputer.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-people-doing-with-chapel">
  <a href="#what-are-people-doing-with-chapel">What Are People Doing With Chapel?</a>
</h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, Chapel is being used for a diverse set of production-grade
applications; these applications have guided the language&rsquo;s development,
pushing it to grow and support real-world computing workloads.</p>
<h4 id="arkouda-interactive-data-analysis-at-scale">
  <a href="#arkouda-interactive-data-analysis-at-scale">Arkouda: Interactive Data Analysis at Scale</a>
</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Bears-R-Us/arkouda/blob/master/README.md"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arkouda</a> is one exciting application
of the Chapel language. It is an open-source data science
library for Python written in Chapel. Arkouda enables users to interactively analyze massive
datasets. Using Chapel enables Arkouda to scale easily; as a concrete example,
its <code>argsort</code> operation, written in around 100 lines of Chapel code, was
able to sort 256 TiB of data in 31 seconds, a rate of 8500 GiB/s! That
throughput was achieved by scaling Arkouda to 8192 compute nodes
on an <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/compute/hpc/supercomputing/cray-exascale-supercomputer.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener">HPE Cray EX</a>
using its <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/compute/hpc/slingshot-interconnect.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slingshot-11 network</a>.
The scaling was made possible through Chapel&rsquo;s built-in support for multi-node execution.</p>
<figure class="fullwide"><img src="../../posts/announcing-chapel-2.0/arkouda-argsort.png"
    alt="Scaling results from Arkouda&rsquo;s argsort function"><figcaption>
      <p>Scaling results from Arkouda&rsquo;s <code>argsort</code> function</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Arkouda allows data scientists to iterate at the speed of thought, even with
datasets spanning terabytes of data &mdash; scales that could never fit into the
memory of a single machine.</p>
<p>All the performance and scalability of Chapel does not come at the cost of
convenience or ergonomics. David Bader, the NJIT professor leading development
of the <a href="https://github.com/Bears-R-Us/arkouda-njit"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arachne</a>
Arkouda module for scalable graph algorithms, has this to say about the language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chapel serves as a powerful tool for the rapid development of scalable graph
analysis algorithms, <strong>standing alone in its capability to enable such
advancements.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h4 id="champs-a-framework-for-computational-fluid-dynamics">
  <a href="#champs-a-framework-for-computational-fluid-dynamics">CHAMPS: A Framework for Computational Fluid Dynamics</a>
</h4>
<p>Another excellent example of Chapel&rsquo;s ergonomics is CHAMPS, a software framework
focused on three-dimensional, unstructured computational fluid dynamics.
CHAMPS is made up of over 125,000 lines of Chapel code, making it the largest
project written in the language. The principal investigator of CHAMPS, Éric
Laurendeau, has <a href="https://youtu.be/wD-a_KyB8aI?t=1904"target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarked on the productivity</a>
gained by switching to Chapel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We ask students at the master’s degree to do stuff that would take 2 years
and they do it in 3 months.</strong> . . . So, if you want to take a summer internship
and you say, . . . &ldquo;program a new turbulence model,&rdquo; well they manage.
And before, it was impossible to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time of this quote, CHAMPS was 48k lines of code, a near threefold
decrease from the 120k lines of its C-based predecessor. In addition to this,
CHAMPS improved upon its predecessor by extending the fluid dynamics simulations
to use distributed memory and be three-dimensional, unstructured,
and multi-physics. Each of these advances represented a step up in complexity. Despite
this, the Chapel-based CHAMPS proved to be easier to learn, program, and maintain.</p>
<h4 id="coral-biodiversity-computation">
  <a href="#coral-biodiversity-computation">Coral Biodiversity Computation</a>
</h4>
<p>One area particularly suited for parallel computing &mdash; and one at which
Chapel excels &mdash; is image analysis. Scott Bachman, an oceanographer and
climate scientist, learned Chapel from the ground up to develop software for
coral reef biodiversity analysis. Scott made use of Chapel&rsquo;s parallel
programming features to develop efficient algorithms for finding ideal
spots for coral preservation. He did so by analyzing an intricate
high-resolution satellite image of an ocean island. Below is how Scott described
his experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have now written three major programs for my work using Chapel, and each
time I was able to significantly increase performance and achieve excellent
parallelism with a low barrier to entry. <strong>Chapel is my go-to language if I
need to stand up a highly performant software stack quickly</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>By making use of parallelism, Scott was able to greatly improve on existing,
serial implementations in Matlab. From Scott&rsquo;s <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/presentations/Bachman-PAW-ATM.pdf"target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation at SC23</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Previous performance (serial, MATLAB): ~ 10 days<br>
Current performance (360x cores, Chapel): ~ 2 seconds<br>
<strong>Roughly 5 orders of magnitude improvement</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth highlighting Chapel&rsquo;s portability. Scott wrote and tested his
programs on a laptop. With only minor modifications &mdash; including tweaks to
enable GPU support &mdash; his code was able to be executed on
<a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frontier</a>, the fastest system
in the <a href="https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/2023/11/"target="_blank" rel="noopener">TOP500</a>, and the only one in that list to
reach a computation speed of one exaflop. Scott&rsquo;s code distributed the problem
across several of Frontier&rsquo;s nodes, and across each of the eight GPUs present
in each node. By doing so, it was able to achieve a massive speedup:
back-of-the-envelope estimations suggest that Scott&rsquo;s program would take 648
hours to run on an 8-core CPU, whereas the 64-node version on Frontier ran
in 20 minutes. In other words, what would&rsquo;ve taken an 8-core machine almost
a month was sped up to less than the length of a lunch break.</p>

<p>In addition to being a significant performance win, this use case highlights an
essential aspect of Chapel: the tools that Chapel provides to developers can
be used for programming diverse parallel hardware. Programs can be scaled from
a laptop, to a GPU-enabled cloud instance, to a supercomputer, using the same
language concepts and features. At the same time, Chapel programs are
<em>vendor-neutral</em> &mdash; they work on a variety of processors, networks, and
GPUs. As a concrete example, GPU-enabled Chapel programs work with both
NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.</p>

</h3>
<p>Chapel was built specifically for parallel computing at scale, guided by
experts and real-world high-performance use cases. Because of this, the
language has many unique features. These features interconnect to form a
consistent and general model for programming diverse parallel hardware,
as I alluded to in the previous section. To get a taste of Chapel,
take a look at the following serial program:</p>

integer array <code>Dst</code>. However, it reorders the numbers it copies &mdash;
the third array, <code>Inds</code>, contains the destination indices for each source index.
In other words, <code>destinationIndex = Inds[sourceIndex]</code>.</p>
<p>When trying to improve the performance of a program like
this, one important thing to consider is that today, even the CPUs of
relatively cheap consumer laptops have multiple processor cores. This means that
they support parallelism. To tweak the above program to allow it to make
use of multiple CPU cores, it&rsquo;s only necessary to change the <code>for</code> to a <code>forall</code>.
If you were to run this on your 8-core M1 Mac, the iterations of the loop would
be divided between those cores, likely resulting in a noticeable speedup over
the original for-loop.</p>

will be executed in a massively parallel fashion by the multiple threads of
the GPU. I covered Chapel&rsquo;s GPU support in some detail in
<a href="../../posts/intro-to-gpus/"><em>Introduction to GPU Programming in Chapel</em></a>.</p>
<p>To scale the program to something like a cluster, cloud instance, or
supercomputer, the programmer has to make use of several compute nodes at
the same time. In this example, that can be achieved by asking Chapel to
distribute the arrays across all compute nodes available to the program.
When doing so, Chapel divides the iterations of the loop &mdash; as well as
the array data itself &mdash; across the nodes&rsquo; memories and processors.</p>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>With additional tweaks, the multi-node and multi-GPU versions of this program
can be combined to distribute computations across all GPUs in an entire cluster.
These are the exact sorts of changes that were made to Scott Bachman&rsquo;s Coral Reef
software above to make it run on Frontier.</p>
<p>The main takeaway is that the same tools &mdash; <code>forall</code> loops and <code>on</code> statements
&mdash; interplay elegantly to fit a wide variety of use cases. Moreover, they
don&rsquo;t sacrifice performance. The multi-node version of the program above (which is the
<a href="https://github.com/jdevinney/bale/blob/master/src/bale_classic/apps/ig_src/README.md"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bale IndexGather</a>
benchmark, by the way), outperforms standard parallel computing technologies:</p>

<p>The code presented up to this point is far from a complete picture of all
of the unique features that Chapel brings to the table; there&rsquo;s just not
enough space here to cover them all.
Some other features to check out are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>sync</code> variables and <code>coforall</code> loops</strong> for explicit parallelism,
covered in depth
in one of our <a href="../../posts/aoc2022-day11-monkeys/">previous blog posts</a></li>
<li><strong>reductions</strong>, for combining a set of elements into a scalar,

<li><strong>promotion</strong>, for seamlessly applying scalar functions to multiple elements at once,
covered in <a href="../../posts/aoc2022-day02-rochambeau/#argument-promotion">a third blog post</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And those are just the parallelism-specific features! Take a look at the
<a href="../../series/advent-of-code-2022/">Advent of Code</a> series for a gentle
introduction to Chapel, including its general-purpose features.</p>

<p>Chapel&rsquo;s 2.0 release also brings improvements to developer tooling.
Along with the latest version of the language, the Chapel team is publishing a
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chpl-hpe.chapel-vscode"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Studio Code extension for Chapel</a>.
This extension provides support for a number of features, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>code diagnostics (syntax and semantic errors), including quick fixes</li>
<li>documentation on hover</li>
<li>go-to-definition, find references</li>
<li>linting for common issues using <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.0/tools/chplcheck/chplcheck.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>chplcheck</code></a></li>
<li>and much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>The VSCode extension is an exciting development, bringing a large number
of modern editor features to users of Chapel. Much like the features of
Chapel itself, there&rsquo;s simply not enough room in this article to show all
of them off. Stay tuned for another article that walks through what the
new extension can do in more detail. In the meantime, as a little teaser,
here&rsquo;s a demonstration of hover information and go-to-definition:</p>

<p>Much of the extension&rsquo;s functionality is provided by a general tool
that uses the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Language Server Protocol</a>.
This new tool, the <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.0/tools/chpl-language-server/chpl-language-server.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chapel language server</a>, can also be used from other editors. For example, members of the Chapel
team use it with Neovim on a daily basis.</p>

</h3>
<p>Chapel has supported developers with various computing needs in creating
performant and maintainable software since 2015, a track record of nearly 10 years.
The 2.0 release represents the culmination of a concerted, multi-year effort to
refine Chapel&rsquo;s core functionality based on these many years of experience. Chapel is now
stable, but it is not finished: the language will continue to see performance
improvements, new features, and better tooling. Whether you are working with
a personal machine or a multi-node cluster, there has been no better time to
get started with Chapel to get the most out of your
computing hardware.</p>

    <div style="padding-left: 2vw; padding-right: 2vw; padding-bottom: 2ch;">
        <p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Chapel 2.0, the three easiest
ways to do so are GitHub Codespaces, Homebrew (on macOS and Linux), and Docker.
For setting up Chapel on other platforms, please see the
<a href="https://chapel-lang.org/download.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download Chapel</a> page on the language&rsquo;s
website.</p>
<h4 id="github-codespaces">
  <a href="#github-codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a>
</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel-hello-world"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chapel template on GitHub</a>
includes a configuration file for <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces"target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Codespaces</a>.
This means that if you have a GitHub account, you can deploy a cloud-based
Chapel development environment in just a couple of clicks. On the template&rsquo;s
page, simply click <strong>Use this template</strong>, then select <strong>Open in a codespace</strong>.</p>
<p>By default, Chapel&rsquo;s Codespace comes pre-equipped with the Chapel compiler,
<code>chpl</code>, as well as the
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chpl-hpe.chapel-vscode"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chapel VSCode extension</a>.
This means that you will have access to tools such as
<a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.0/tools/chpl-language-server/chpl-language-server.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener">the language server</a>
and <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/2.0/tools/chplcheck/chplcheck.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>chplcheck</code></a>
out of the box, with no further setup on your part.</p>

<p>Since the template comes with a <code>hello.chpl</code> file, you should be able to
compile and run it using the following commands in the Codespace&rsquo;s <strong>Terminal</strong>
tab:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">chpl hello.chpl
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">./hello
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The above should result in a single line of output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">Hello, world!
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>From there, check out the <code>examples/</code> folder for more advanced
versions of ‘Hello, World!’, or try your own Chapel programs.</p>
<h4 id="homebrew">
  <a href="#homebrew">Homebrew</a>
</h4>
<p>The Chapel 2.0 release is available from Homebrew under the <code>chapel</code> package:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">brew update
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">brew install chapel
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>From there, you can use the <code>chpl</code> command to compile Chapel source files.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;writeln(&#34;Hello, world!&#34;);&#39;</span> &gt; hello.chpl
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">chpl hello.chpl
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">./hello
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The above should result in a single line of output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">Hello, world!
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="docker">
  <a href="#docker">Docker</a>
</h4>
<p>The Chapel team maintains <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/chapel"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker images</a>
with the latest version of the language. To get started, pull the
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/chapel/chapel/"target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>chapel/chapel</code></a> image from DockerHub:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">docker pull chapel/chapel
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>From there, you can start up the image and use the <code>chpl</code> compiler as normal.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;writeln(&#34;Hello, world!&#34;);&#39;</span> &gt; hello.chpl
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">docker run --rm -it -v <span class="s2">&#34;</span><span class="nv">$PWD</span><span class="s2">&#34;</span>:/myapp -w /myapp chapel/chapel /bin/bash
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># The following lines are from within a bash session in the Docker image</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">root@xxxxxxxxx:/myapp# chpl -o hello hello.chpl
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">root@xxxxxxxxx:/myapp# ./hello
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The above should print a single line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">Hello, world!
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can find more instructions for using the image on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/chapel/chapel/"target="_blank" rel="noopener">its DockerHub page</a>.
Also consider trying out other Chapel images, such as <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/chapel/chapel-gasnet"target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>chapel/chapel-gasnet</code></a>, which supports simulated <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/usingchapel/multilocale.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener">multilocale execution</a>
of Chapel programs.</p>
