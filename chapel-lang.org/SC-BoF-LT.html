<p>
We are pleased to announce the Fourth Annual Chapel Lightning Talks
<em>Birds-of-a-Feather</em> session at SC14 this November.  The BoF is
designed to highlight interesting work being done in or around Chapel
across the broad community: research collaborations, use of Chapel in
education, application studies, supporting technologies, etc.</p>

<p>As in previous years, we anticipate having ~6 talks @ 5 minutes
each as the core of the session.  We'll start with a brief overview of
the Chapel project to provide context for the talks (also limited to 5
minutes) and will wrap up with a Q&amp;A session involving all the
speakers.</p>

<p>To propose a talk, please send the following information to
<b><?php include("email-submissions.html");?></b> by October 10th:</p>
<ul>
<li>a proposed title

<li>a paragraph summarizing what you'd cover in your 5 minutes

<li>a short speaker bio

<li>(optional, but recommended) sample slides from previous talks
     demonstrating that you can create engaging slides; or that you've
     presented a short, lightning-style talk before.  (Note that these
     can be from any technical talk or lecture; they don't need to be
     related to your proposed topic in any way).
</ul>

<p>From the submissions, the organizers will curate a program for the
 BoF, attempting to emphasize diverse and novel work.  We will strive
 to prioritize new work relative to the previous lightning talks BoFs,
 though speakers from previous years are definitely encouraged to
 submit a talk that highlights new work or progress.</p>
