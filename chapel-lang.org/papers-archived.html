        <i>This paper presents a compiler optimization that targets
          irregular memory accesses patterns in Chapel
          programs. Specifically, it uses static analysis to identify
          irregular memory accesses to distributed arrays in parallel
          loops and employs code transformations to generate an
          inspector and executor to perform selective data replication
          at runtime.</i>
