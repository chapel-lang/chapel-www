<h2>Chapel Research and Collaborations</h2>

<p>This page lists groups who are working on Chapel-related research
and development external to the core development team.  If you believe
your project belongs on this list (or it needs updating), please let
us know.  We encourage Chapel-related R&amp;D and include a list of
possible research topics at the bottom of this page.  </p>

<h3>Active Groups:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><a href = "http://www.lbl.gov"><b>Berkeley Lab</b></a>: We
    work closely with the <a href = "https://gasnet.lbl.gov/">GASNet
    team</a> whose portable communication library serves as our
    portable distributed-memory communication infrastructure.</li>

    <p></p>

 
    <li> <a href =
          "http://www.cs.arizona.edu/"><b>University of
          Arizona</b></a>, <a href =
          "https://www.haverford.edu/"><b>Haverford College</b></a>:
          We are investigating how Chapel Iterators can enable the use
          of complex tiling strategies like diamond tiling by
          programmers in stencil codes with
          <a href="https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~ianbertolacci/">Ian
          Bertolacci</a>,
          <a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/~mstrout/">Michelle

          Wonnacott</a> (and previously, Cathie Olschanowsky
          at <a href = "http://www.cs.colostate.edu">Colorado State
