    big-data analytics, using tensor decomposition to extract patterns
    from large, sparse multivariate data is a popular technique. Many
    challenges exist for designing parallel, high performance tensor
    decomposition algorithms due to irregular data accesses and the
    growing size of tensors that are processed. There have been many
    efforts at implementing shared-memory algorithms for tensor
    decomposition, most of which have focused on the traditional C/C++
    with OpenMP framework. However, Chapel is becoming an increasingly
    popular programing language due to its expressiveness and
    simplicity for writing scalable parallel programs. In this work,
    we port a state of the art C/OpenMP parallel sparse tensor
    decomposition tool, SPLATT, to Chapel. We present a performance
    study that investigates bottlenecks in our Chapel code and
    discuss approaches for improving its performance. Also, we
    discuss features in Chapel that would have been beneficial to our
    porting effort. We demonstrate that our Chapel code is competitive
    with the C/OpenMP code for both runtime and scalability, achieving
    83%-96% performance of the original code and near linear
    scalability up to 32 cores.</font></small>

    optimization of dense array codes often depends upon the selection
    of the appropriate execution order for the iterations of nested
    loops. Tools based on the Polyhedral Model have demonstrated
    dramatic success in performing such optimizations on many such
    codes, but others remain an area of active research, leaving
    programmers to optimize code in other ways.

    <p>Bertolacci et. al demonstrated that programmer-defined
      iterators can be used to explore iteration-space reorderings,
      and that Cray’s compiler for the Chapel language can optimize
      such codes to be competitive with polyhedral tools. This
      “iterator-based” approach allows programmers to explore
      iteration orderings not identified by automatic optimizers, but
      was only demonstrated for perfectly-nested loops, and lacked any
      system for warning about an iterator that would produce an
      incorrect result.

    <p>We have now addressed these shortcomings of iterator-based loop
    optimization, and explored the use of our improved techniques to
    optimize the imperfectly-nested loops that form the core of
    Nussinov’s algorithm for RNA secondary-structure prediction. Our
    C++ iterator provides performance that equals the fastest C code,
    several times faster than was achieved by using the same C
    compiler on the code with the original iteration ordering, or the
    code produced by the Pluto loop optimizer. Our Chapel iterators
    produce run-time that is competitive with the equivalent
    iterator-free Chapel code, though the Chapel performance still
    does not equal that of the C/C++ code.

    <p>We have also implemented an iterator that produces an
    incorrect-but-fast version of Nussinov’s algorithm, and used this
    iterator to illustrate our approaches to error-detection. Manual
    application of our compile-time error-detection algorithm (which
    has yet to be integrated into a compiler) identifies this error,
    as does the run-time approach that we use for codes on which the
    static test proves inconclusive.</font></small>

    node architectures are quickly becoming the de facto choice in
    scalable supercomputers. Efficient layout and placement of shared
    data structures is critical in attaining desired performance on
    such systems. However, with most high-level programming languages,
    the programmer has to manually explore the optimal data
    organization strategy for their workloads. This paper explores
    automatic and semi- automatic data layout transformations for
    heterogeneous memory architectures using Chapel as a reference
    high-level language. We first identify computation and data access
    patterns that are problematic for hybrid nodes, then propose
    solutions to rectify these situations by converting inferior data
    layouts to efficient ones, and finally outline implementation
    strategies in Chapel. We demonstrate that the domain map feature
    in Chapel can be leveraged to implement sophisticated layout
    transforms for heterogeneous memory systems. Preliminary
    evaluation shows that the proposed transformations can make up to
    an order-of-magnitude difference in performance for GPU kernels
    with certain characteristics.</font></small>

          storage, I also present a novel extension to the
          Read-Copy-Update synchronization strategy that functions
          without the need for either. At 32-nodes with 44-cores per
          node the RCUArray’s relative performance to an
          unsynchronized Chapel block distributed array is as little
          as 20% for read and update operations, but with runtime
          support for zero-overhead RCU and thread-local or task-local
          storage it has the potential to be near-equivalent; relative
          performance for resize operations is as much as 3600% due to
          the novel design. </font></small>

    <td><small><b>Abstract:</b> <font color="DarkBlue">In the next few
    years, exascale computing systems will become available to the
    scientific community.  These systems will require new levels of
    parallelization, new models of memory and storage, and a variety
    of node architectures for processors and accelerators.  In the
    decade that follows, we can expect more of these changes, as well
    as increasing levels of hardware specialization.  These systems
    will provide simulation and analysis capabilities at unprecedented
    scales, and when combined with advanced physical models,
    mathematical and statistical methods, and computer science and
    abstractions, they will lead to scientific breakthroughs.  Yet the
    full power of these systems will only be realized if there is
    sufficient high-level programming support that will abstract
    details of the machines and give programmers a natural interface
    for writing new science applications.

    In this talk I will discuss the importance of programming
    languages, and the need for high-level abstractions and more
    powerful compilers to reach future science goals.  And how does
    one move an existing community with large code bases into new
    languages?  I will use my own experience from both general-purpose
    and special-purpose languages, and extrapolate to some of the key
    opportunities and challenges facing the Chapel language.</p>
