<b><big>Overview</big></b><br>
</p>
<div class="indent">

<p>CHIUW 2017 is the fourth annual <a href = "CHIUW.html">Chapel
Implementers and Users Workshop</a>, to be held in conjunction
with <a href = "http://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2017/">IEEE IPDPS 2017</a>.  This
workshop will continue our annual series bringing users and developers
of the Chapel language&nbsp;(<a href =
"https://chapel-lang.org">chapel-lang.org</a>) together to report on
work being done with the language and explore ways to advance Chapel.
Attendance is open to anyone interested in Chapel, from the seasoned
enthusiast to someone simply curious to learn more.
</p>
</div>


<p>
<b><big>Format</big></b> <br>
<div class="indent">

<p>The first day of the workshop will be presentation- and
discussion-based, as in previous years&mdash;essentially, a full-day
mini-conference focusing on Chapel.  We also anticipate holding our
traditional "code camp" session on the second day to support
pair-programming and collaborative activites.  In more detail:
</p>


<p>
<b>Mini-Conference Day:</b> The backbone of the main day will be made
up of talks submitted by members of the community describing
Chapel-related research and development that they are pursuing.  Other
activities during this first day will include:

<ul>
<li> A pre-workshop introduction to Chapel for those new to the language
<li> A "State of the Chapel Project" talk
<li> A keynote speaker (TBD)
<li> A community or panel discussion on Chapel's next steps and future
</ul>

<p>
Interested parties are encouraged to submit papers and talks using the
process outlined <a href = "#callForSubmissions">below</a>.  The
selection of the final program's contents will be decided upon by the
workshop's <a href = "#committee">program committee</a>.</p>

<p>For CHIUW 2017, we will be accepting submissions in two forms:
(1)&nbsp;full research papers and (2)&nbsp;talk-only extended
abstracts.  We anticipate that accepted papers will be awarded longer
talk slots than their talk-only counterparts.  Papers will be
included in the IEEE IPDPS workshop proceedings which will be
distributed at the conference and submitted for inclusion in the IEEE
Xplore Digital Library after the conference. Submitted papers that
are not accepted for publication at CHIUW 2017 will automatically be
considered for the talk-only track.  All talk slides and materials
developed for the workshop will be archived on the CHIUW workshop
website.
</p>

<p>
<a id = "codecamp"></a>
<b>Code Camp Day:</b></a> Pending sufficient interest, CHIUW 2017 will
also include a "code-camp" session on June 3rd, intended for
collaborative Chapel explorations.  For example, we often partner
community members who are striving to gain experience with Chapel or
its implementation with more experienced Chapel users or developers.
If you have a specific topic or activity that you'd like to propose
for this day (e.g., "I'd like to work with someone to try coding
algorithm x in Chapel" or "I'd like someone to help me get familiar
with aspect y of the Chapel compiler/runtime/module code"), please
submit it using the process below.

<b><big>Call For Submissions</big></b><br>
</p>

<div class="indent">

<b>Paper Submissions:</b> If you have Chapel-related work that you
would like to publish at CHIUW as part of the IEEE IPDPS proceedings,
please prepare your manuscript according to the <a href =
"http://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2017/2017_call_for_papers.html">IEEE IPDPS
2017 call for papers</a> (see "What/Where to Submit") and submit it
via the <a href =
"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chiuw2017">CHIUW 2017
EasyChair site</a> by the <a href = "#dates">submission deadline</a>
below.  All accepted papers will be governed by the IEEE IPDPS
workshop publication deadlines and procedures.  Papers that are not
accepted for publication at CHIUW 2017 will automatically be
considered as topics for the talk-only track unless the author
indicates otherwise in their submission.</p>



<b>Talk Proposals:</b> To propose a talk at CHIUW without an
accompanying research paper, please send a 1&ndash;2 page extended
abstract using reasonable formatting and a 10- or 11-point font.
Extended abstracts should be several paragraphs long and give as
detailed a preview of the talk's contents as possible.  Submissions
will be considered on the basis of the novelty and maturity of the
work.  Talk-only submissions should be sure to include:

<ul>
<li> The title of the talk
<li> The list of authors and their affiliations
<li> The presenting author
</ul>

</p>

Submit your extended abstract via the <a href =
"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chiuw2017">CHIUW 2017
EasyChair site</a> by the <a href = "#dates">submission deadline</a>
below.</p>

<p>
<b>Code Camp Proposals:</b> If you would like to participate in a
pair-programming or collaborative activity on the code-camp day,
please send a short paragraph describing the activity
to <b><?php include("email-submissions.html");?></b> We hope to be
able to accept all reasonable proposals, the primary constraint being
the number of viable partners in attendance.  For this reason, from a
planning/resource perspective, the earlier we receive these proposals
the better, though we will consider additional ad-hoc activities right
up to the code camp day itself (to support ideas that are generated
during the first day's talks, for example).
</p>

<p>
<b>Other Proposals:</b> Chapel is a community language and our
intention is for CHIUW to become an increasingly community-run event,
so if you have proposals for other activities that you would like to
see take place at CHIUW (particularly if you're interested in leading
that activity), please let us know by
mailing <b><?php include("email-submissions.html");?></b>
