<p>
<small><b>Introduction:</b> CHIUW 2021 is the 8th annual <a href =
"CHIUW.html">Chapel Implementers and Users Workshop</a>. CHIUW serves as a forum
where users and developers of the Chapel language&nbsp;(<a href =
"https://chapel-lang.org">chapel-lang.org</a>) can gather to report on
work being done with Chapel, exchange ideas, and forge new
collaborations.  Anyone interested in parallel programming and Chapel
is encouraged to attend CHIUW, from long-term enthusiasts to those
simply curious to learn more.</small>
</p>

<p>
<small><b>Format:</b> Due to Covid-19, CHIUW 2021 will be held online
in a virtual workshop format.  Talks will be given by speakers, either
live or via pre-recorded videos (linked below when available).  Each
talk will be followed by a short question-and-answer session.  Short
breaks between speakers and sessions will be used to deal with any
challenges that come up as a result of the distributed setting.  Due
to the large number of timezones involved, there will not be any
formal meal breaks, but you're encouraged to eat while watching the
talks or during the breaks.
</small>
</p>

<p>
<small><b>Registration:</b> Registration for CHIUW 2021 is free and can be completed at <a href = "https://hpe.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0ldumppj0rEtCAGHNsMRcqYGJSqTFyjARv">this link</a>

            This talk will highlight recent optimizations that have
            significantly improved Chapel's performance and scalability on
            InfiniBand systems. Enhancements to the memory registration
            implementation have improved the performance of several core
            benchmarks and user applications including Arkouda, a Python package
            backed by Chapel that provides a key subset of the NumPy and Pandas
            interfaces. Performance results for core benchmarks will be shown on
            a small-scale InfiniBand cluster and Arkouda results will be shown
            on a 240 node InfiniBand-based HPE Apollo system.

            In recent releases, we have added two locality-based optimizations
            to the Chapel compiler. These optimizations enable the compiler to
            statically determine the locality of array accesses and to aggregate
            fine-grained copy operations. In this talk, we summarize how they
            are implemented, their impact on various programming idioms,
            associated performance improvements, and pertinent future
            directions.

            Aircraft design and analysis have, historically, always been a
            technology pull whether in the defense or commercial sectors.
            Computational Fluid Dynamics has been, since the 1960’s, a
            technology push by scientists.  Taken together, they have been a
            formidable technology pull for High Performance Computing which
            itself, has been pushed by the incredible rise in computing
            capabilities.

             The talk will present a crash course in aircraft design and in
             particular the aerodynamic analysis viewed through the various
             mathematical models. The discretization of these into coupled
             systems will present some challenges. The impact of HPC on
             industrial processes, including aircraft certification, will be
             discussed. Some case studies will demonstrate the need for ever
             increased software and hardware developments as exemplified by
             NASA’s current vision for 2030.

        <b>Abstract:</b>
          <font color="DarkBlue">
            This paper presents an aircraft ice accretion simulation suite
            implemented in the Chapel programming language for deterministic and
            stochastic ice accretion in two (2D) and three (3D) dimensions. The
            work is performed inside the CHApel Multi-Physics Simulation
            software (CHAMPS) developed at Polytechnique Montreal since 2019.
            Different physical models are added to the flow solver to simulate
            the droplet trajectories, the surface thermodynamic exchanges, and
            the surface deformation. The object-oriented approach used in the
            development of CHAMPS, combined with the generic functions and types
            from Chapel, allowed the development of a code that is easy to
            maintain and that still has high growth potential. The latest
            extension to CHAMPS is the capability to perform stochastic ice
            accretion using an advancing front grid methodology at the core and
            by randomly distributing the droplets, like in a cloud. Although
            stochastic ice accretion is not new, this paper presents an original
            methodology that has advantages over other methods from the
            literature, such as conserving a valid surface mesh from the
            beginning to the end of the stochastic accretion. Multi-layer ice
            accretion results are presented in 2D and 3D for a deterministic
            methodology, whereas single-layer 2D results are presented for the
            stochastic method.

          <font color="DarkBlue">
            Tree-based search algorithms applied to combinatorial optimization
            problems are highly irregular and time-consuming when it comes to
            solving big instances. Due to their highly parallel nature,
            algorithms of this class have been revisited for different parallel
            architectures over the years. These parallelization efforts have
            always been guided by the performance objective setting aside
            productivity.

            However, dealing with scalability implicitly induces
            the heterogeneity issue, which means that different programming
            models/languages, runtimes and libraries need to be employed
            ensemble for efficiently exploiting all levels of parallelism of
            large-scale systems. As a consequence, efforts towards productivity
            are crucial for harnessing the future generation of supercomputers.
            In this talk proposal, we present our efforts towards
            productivity-aware ultra-scale tree search using the Chapel
            language. Four topics are covered in this document: the design and
            implementation of tree-search using Chapel, improving intra-node
            efficiency, the use of GPUs and future perspectives.

            This paper discusses the parallelisation (using the programming
            language Chapel) of one of the most well quoted algorithms for the
            Singular Value Decomposition of a matrix. The mathematical
            alterations and programming constructs used to achieve that
            parallelisation are examined at length. Performance and validation
            tests showing the increased parallel performance that occurs when
            running on a multi-core computer architecture are documented. The
            serial performance is compared against Fortran code that implements
            the original algorithm. Only parallelisation in a Symmetric
            Multi-Processing (SMP) environment is explored.

          <font color="DarkBlue">
            Chapel is inherently well suited not only for homogeneous nodes but
            also heterogeneous nodes because they employ the concept of locales,
            distributed domains, forall/reduce constructs, and implicit
            communications. However, it is unfortunate that there is room for
            further improvements in supporting GPU in Chapel.

          <font color="DarkBlue">
            This paper addresses some of the key limitations of past approaches
            on mapping Chapel on to GPUs as follows. We introduce the GPUAPI
            module, which provides multi-level abstractions of existing
            low-level GPU API such as CUDA runtime API. This module allows
            Chapel programmers to have the option of explicitly manipulating
            device memory (de)allocation and data transfer API at the Chapel
            level while maintaining good performance and productivity. The
            GPUAPI module is useful particularly when they dive into lower-level
            details to incrementally evolve their GPU implementations for
            improved performance on multiple heterogeneous nodes.
            We provide two tiers of GPU API: the MID-LOW-level API and the
            MID-level API. The MID-LOW-level API offers thin wrappers for raw
            GPU API routines, whereas the MID-level API provides Chapel
            programmer-friendly interface - i.e., allocating device memory using
            the 'new' keyword. Also, the module allows the coexistence of
            different levels of API even with the prototype GPU code generator
            in Chapel 1.24.

            Our preliminary performance and productivity evaluations show that
            the use of the GPUAPI module significantly simplifies the
            manipulation of GPU API in Chapel for multiple CPUs+GPUs nodes while
            achieving the same performance.

            This talk discusses experiences of a summer intern in getting up and
            running on distributed memory systems using Chapel. During the
            course of the summer, the presenter learned how to use
            supercomputers thanks to the abstraction of complicated distributed
            computing concepts and high-level syntax of Chapel. Furthermore,
            this talk highlights significant contributions made to the
            performance of Arkouda, which is a NumPy-like Python package with a
            Chapel backend server that allows data scientists to interactively
            utilize supercomputers. The design of Arkouda will be outlined to
            better explain work accomplished and performance graphs of the
            improvements will be shown.

            Programming languages that implement the Partitioned Global Address
            Space (PGAS) model offer a simplified approach to writing parallel
            distributed applications, since explicit message passing is
            abstracted from the user. While the PGAS model offers high
            productivity, communication costs can still be a bottleneck for
            application performance. Applications that exhibit sparse and
            indirect memory accesses to distributed data pose a significant
            challenge to performance. These irregular applications lack spatial
            and temporal locality, leading to fine-grained remote communication
            that is not known until runtime. In this work, we investigate
            runtime optimizations for distributed irregular applications within
            the Chapel programming language. We focus on the inspector-executor
            technique, which evaluates a kernel of interest at runtime and
            constructs an optimized version of that kernel for execution. For
            our preliminary study, we hand-code the inspector and executor to
            demonstrate that runtime speed-ups as large as 224x, 13x and 96x are
            possible for Conjugate Gradient, a molecular dynamics simulation,
            and PageRank kernels, respectively.

            Exploratory graph analytics helps maximize the informational value
            for a graph. However, the increasing graph size makes it impossible
            for existing popular exploratory data analysis tools, such as
            Python, to handle dozens-of-terabytes or even larger data sets in
            the memory of a common laptop/personal computer. Arkouda is a
            framework under early-development that brings together the
            productivity of Python at the user side with the high-performance of
            Chapel at the server side. In this paper, the preliminary work on
            overcoming the memory limit and high performance computing coding
            roadblock for high level Python users to do large graph analysis is
            presented. A simple and succinct graph data structure design and
            implementation at both the Python front-end and the Chapel back-end
            in the Arkouda framework are provided. Less memory occupation and
            O(1) time complexity for neighbour vertices and adjacency edge
            searching are the major features of the proposed graph data
            structure. A typical graph algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS), is
            used to show how we can use Chapel to develop high performance
            parallel graph algorithm productively. Two Chapel based parallel
            Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms, one high level version and
            one optimized version, have been implemented in Arkouda to support
            large graph analyzing. Multiple graph benchmarks are used to
            evaluate the performance of the provided graph algorithms.
            Experimental results show that how we can optimize the performance
            using suitable Chapel high level data structure, parallel constructs
            and simple algorithm description efficiently. All our code is open
            source and available from GitHub
            (https://github.com/Bader-Research/arkouda/tree/graph-multilocales).

          <font color="DarkBlue">
            The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) community has successfully
            leveraged GPUs for their solvers. In the industry, low-order solvers
            are often used because only engineering levels of accuracy are
            needed. Unlike high-order methods, these solvers don't have high
            ratios of floating point operations per memory fetches but can still
            make good use of GPUs because of the high number of elements
            computed and higher memory bandwidth of those types of hardware.
            These solvers often use solvers that were designed to be optimal for
            CPUs with sequential parts like the Symmetric Gauss Seidel (SGS)
            solver. In an attempt to adapt to the hardware architecture and to
            better utilize the computational power of the GPU, a Jacobian-free
            Newton-Krylov (JFNK) type of solver is envisioned. The JFNK solver
            makes use of the fact that only the effect of the Jacobian on a
            vector is needed, hence removing the need to store and inverse the
            Jacobian matrix. Instead, a finite-difference approximation is
            computed. This paper discusses the early implementation of such a
            solver by showing the performance on the GPU of a GMRES solver (with
            Jacobian) developed in CHAMPS, a 3D unstructured RANS solver written
            in Chapel. The performance is evaluated by presenting speedups and a
            strong scaling analysis of the method.

          <font color="DarkBlue">
            Coordinating many runs of monothilic high performance computing
            (HPC) applications is a challenge faced by much of the HPC user
            community.  This includes domains such as data science,
            bioinformatics, astronomy, and computational chemistry. For simple
            cases, users tend to rely on shell scripts that interact with the
            system workload manager to launch their applications. However, more
            advanced workflows can require complexity beyond what can reasonably
            be accomplished in a shell script.  A more productive programming
            language is needed to tackle these more complex tasks.  Cray HPO is
            a black-box hyperparameter optimization framework written in Chapel.
            The framework employs many advanced workflow features, such as
            parallel launching, time budgets, and variable node counts. This
            talk will explore some HPC workflow design patterns encountered in
            the development Cray HPO and demonstrate why Chapel works well in
            this area.
