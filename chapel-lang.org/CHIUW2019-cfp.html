<b><big>Summary</big></b><br>
<div class="indent">

<p>
<p>CHIUW 2019 is the sixth annual <a href = "CHIUW.html">Chapel
Implementers and Users Workshop</a>, held in conjunction with <a href
= "https://pldi19.sigplan.org/home">PLDI&nbsp;2019</a> and <a href =
"https://fcrc.acm.org/">ACM FCRC&nbsp;2019</a>, and sponsored
by <a href = "https://www.sigplan.org/">ACM SIGPLAN</a>.  CHIUW's goal
is to serve as a forum where users and developers of the Chapel
language&nbsp;(<a href =
"https://chapel-lang.org">chapel-lang.org</a>) can gather to exchange
ideas and report on work being done with Chapel and in support of it.
Anyone is welcome to attend, from long-term Chapel enthusiasts to
those simply curious to learn more.
</p>

<b><big>Topics</big></b><br>
</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>Topics of interest for CHIUW include:

<ul>
<li> User experiences writing applications in Chapel
<li> Improvements to the Chapel language or its implementation
<li> Performance or benchmark studies in Chapel
<li> Libraries or tools for Chapel programmers
<li> Comparisons to other programming models
<li> Uses of Chapel in education
<li> Other topics likely to be of interest to Chapel programmers
</ul>

</p>
</div>


<p>
<b><big>Format</big></b> <br>
<div class="indent">

<p>CHIUW 2019 is a full-day workshop consisting of Chapel-related
presentations.  With sufficient interest, we may also add a second day
focused on coding in Chapel.

In more detail:
</p>


<p>
<b>Talks Day:</b> The main day of CHIUW will primarily be made up
of submitted presentations describing Chapel-related research and
development being undertaken by the community.  Those interested in
submitting research papers or talks should refer to the <a href =
"#submissions">Submissions</a> section below.

<p>Other workshop activities will include:

<ul>
<li> A keynote talk from <a href = "https://www.anl.gov/profile/anshu-dubey">Anshu Dubey</a>, <i>Argonne National Laboratory</i>
<li> A pre-workshop introduction to Chapel for those new to the language
<li> A "State of the Chapel Project" talk
<li> An impromptu lightning talks session and/or
<li> A panel/community discussion on Chapel priorities and next steps
</ul>
</p>


<p>
<a id = "codeday"></a>
<b>Coding Day:</b></a> Pending interest, CHIUW 2019 will also include
a coding session on June 23rd.  In past instances of CHIUW, this day
has been used for activities like writing specific computations in
Chapel, exploring Chapel support for GPUs, teaching users how to write
distributions, and getting Chapel running on AWS.  Some possible ideas
for this year include holding a hackathon to add functionality to
Chapel library modules or to port a standard suite of coding patterns
to Chapel.  That said, we'd love to hear your ideas and suggestions as
to what would make this day most valuable to you.  Let us know at:
 <b><?php include("email-submissions.html");?></b>

<b><big>Submissions</big></b><br>
</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>Submissions to CHIUW 2019 can made in one of two forms:
(1)&nbsp;full research papers and (2)&nbsp;talk proposals.  Accepted
papers will be published as workshop proceedings in the ACM Digital
Library.  Papers that are not accepted for publication at CHIUW 2019
will automatically be considered for the talk-only track.  The final
set of talks will be selected by the workshop's <a href =
"#organization">program and steering committees</a>.  All presentation
materials will be archived on the <a href = "CHIUW2019.html">CHIUW
2019</a> website.
</p>


<p>
<b>Paper Submissions:</b> If you have novel Chapel-related work that
you would like to publish at CHIUW as part of its official
proceedings, please prepare your manuscript using the official <a href
= "http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/">SIGPLAN format</a> (using
the 'sigplan' subformat) and submit it via <a href =
"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chiuw2019">EasyChair</a> by
the <a href = "#dates">submission deadline</a> below.  Paper
submissions should not exceed 10 pages and should use 10pt fonts.
</p>

<p>In submitting a paper, authors should be aware of the <a href =

accepted papers will need to choose between one of the following
options with respect to copyright:
<ol>

<li> Authors retain copyright of the work and grant ACM a
non-exclusive permission-to-publish license (and, optionally, license
the work with a <a href = "https://creativecommons.org/">Creative
Commons license</a>)

<li> Authors retain copyright of the work and grant ACM an exclusive
permssion-to-publish license

<li> Authors transfer copyright of the work to ACM.
</ol>

Authors are also encouraged to publish auxiliary material (e.g.,
source code, test data, additional technical materials) that will help
others reproduce their work, and will retain copyright over such
material.  For more information, please refer to the following pages

</ul>
</p>


<b>Talk-only Proposals:</b> To propose a talk at CHIUW without an
accompanying research paper, please send a short description (2 pages
or less) of what you would like to present.  CHIUW talks may preview
work that's not ready/intended for publication and/or recap work that
has previously been published elsewhere.  Talk proposals will be
evaluated based on their expected level of interest to the CHIUW
audience and should include:

<ul>
<li> The title of the talk
<li> The list of contributors and their affiliations
<li> The presenting author
<li> A clear description of the talk's contents
<li> Preliminary results or supporting materials (if appropriate / available)
</ul>
