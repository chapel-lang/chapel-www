<b><big>Introduction</big></b><br>
</p>
<div class="indent">

<p>CHIUW 2018 is the fifth annual <a href = "CHIUW.html">Chapel
Implementers and Users Workshop</a>, to be held in conjunction
with <a href = "http://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2018/">IEEE IPDPS 2018</a>.  This
workshop will continue our annual series bringing users and developers
of the Chapel language&nbsp;(<a href =
"https://chapel-lang.org">chapel-lang.org</a>) together to report on
work being done with the language and to advance the Chapel effort.
Attendance is open to anyone interested in Chapel, from the seasoned
enthusiast to someone simply curious to learn more.
</p>
</div>


<p>
<b><big>Format</big></b> <br>
<div class="indent">

<p>The first day of the workshop will essentially be a full-day
mini-conference focusing on Chapel-related material.  We also
anticipate holding our traditional "code camp" session on the second
day to support pair-programming and collaborative activities.  In more
detail:
</p>


<p>
<b>Mini-Conference Day:</b> The main day will primarily be composed of
submitted talks describing Chapel-related research and development
being pursued in the broad community.  Those interested in submitting
novel research papers or talks should refer to the <a href =
"#callForSubmissions">Call For Submissions</a> section below.  The
final program's talks will be selected by the workshop's <a href =
"#committee">program committee</a>.</p>

<p>For CHIUW 2018, we will be accepting submissions in two forms:
(1)&nbsp;full research papers and (2)&nbsp;talk-only extended
abstracts.  Accepted papers will be included in the IEEE IPDPS
workshop proceedings which will be distributed at the conference and
submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the
conference. Submitted papers that are not accepted for publication at
CHIUW 2018 will automatically be considered for the talk-only track.
All talk slides and materials developed for the workshop will be
archived on the CHIUW workshop website.
</p>

<p>Other likely activities during this first day will include:

<ul>
<li> A pre-workshop introduction to Chapel for those new to the language
<li> A "State of the Chapel Project" talk
<li> A keynote speaker (TBD)
<li> An impromptu lightning talks session
<li> Some sort of community discussion on Chapel priorities and next steps
</ul>
</p>


<p>
<a id = "codecamp"></a>
<b>Code Camp Day:</b></a> Pending sufficient interest, CHIUW 2018 will
also include a "code-camp" session on May 26th, intended for
collaborative Chapel explorations.  We typically partner community
members who are striving to gain experience with Chapel or its
implementation with more experienced users or developers.  If you have
a specific topic or activity that you'd like to propose for this day
(e.g., "I'd like to work with someone to try coding algorithm x in
Chapel" or "I'd like someone to help me get familiar with aspect y of
the Chapel module/runtime/compiler code"), please submit it using the
process below.

</p>

<div class="indent">

<b>Paper Submissions:</b> If you have Chapel-related work that you
would like to publish at CHIUW as part of the IEEE IPDPS workshop
proceedings, please prepare your manuscript according to the <a href =
"http://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2018/2018_call_for_papers.html">IEEE IPDPS
2018 call for papers</a> (see "What/Where to Submit") and submit it
via the <a href =
"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chiuw2018">CHIUW 2018
EasyChair site</a> by the <a href = "#dates">submission deadline</a>
below.  All accepted papers will be governed by the IEEE IPDPS
workshop publication deadlines and procedures.  Papers that are not
accepted for publication at CHIUW 2018 will automatically be
considered as topics for the talk-only track unless the author
indicates otherwise in their submission.</p>



<b>Talk-only Proposals:</b> To propose a talk at CHIUW without an
accompanying research paper, please send a 1&ndash;2 page extended
abstract / short paper using reasonable formatting and a 10- or
11-point font.  These submissions should be several paragraphs long
and give as detailed a preview of the talk's contents as possible.
Talk submissions may summarize previously published work or preview
work not yet ready for publication.  These submissions will be
evaluated based on the novelty and maturity of the work combined with
the expected level of interest to the CHIUW audience.  Talk-only
submissions should be sure to include:

<ul>
<li> The title of the talk
<li> The list of authors and their affiliations
<li> The presenting author
</ul>

</p>

Submit your extended abstract via the 
<a href = "https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chiuw2018">CHIUW
2018 EasyChair site</a> by the <a href = "#dates">submission
deadline</a> below.</p>

<p>
<b>Code Camp Proposals:</b> If you would like to participate in a
pair-programming or collaborative activity on the code-camp day,
please send a short paragraph describing the activity
to <b><?php include("email-submissions.html");?></b> We hope to be
able to accept all reasonable proposals, the primary constraint being
the number of viable partners in attendance.  For this reason, from a
planning/resource perspective, the earlier we receive these proposals
the better, though we will consider additional ad-hoc activities right
up to the code camp day itself (to support ideas that are generated
during the first day's talks, for example).
</p>

<p>
<b>Other Proposals:</b> Chapel is a community language and our
intention is for CHIUW to become an increasingly community-run event,
so if you have proposals for other activities that you would like to
see take place at CHIUW (particularly if you're interested in leading
that activity), please let us know by
mailing <b><?php include("email-submissions.html");?></b>
