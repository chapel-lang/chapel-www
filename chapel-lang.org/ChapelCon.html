<h2>ChapelCon</h2>

<p>
ChapelCon is an annual forum
for users and developers of the <a href =
"https://chapel-lang.org">Chapel language</a> to gather, converse, and
report on work being done with Chapel and in support of it.  Anyone is
welcome to attend, whether a long-term Chapel enthusiast or someone
simply curious to learn more about it.
</p>

<p>
In 2024, CHIUW (Chapel Implementers and Users Workshop) was rebranded as
ChapelCon. This <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/blog/posts/chapelcon24/">blog
article</a> has more context about rebranding.
